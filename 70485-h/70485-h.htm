THINGS WHICH BELONG—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE dropped the pen.... More strictly
speaking, it fell as if weighted from his
fingers. He had an extraordinary feeling that
he would never use a pen again.</p>

<p>A flush came into Mattie’s face, but she said
nothing. He had always expected that, if
ever this moment arrived,—impossible as it had
seemed that it ever <i>should</i> arrive,—she would
meet it with a flood of joyful speech; but now
she was silent. It was the second time this
evening that she had surprised him by her
silence,—this wan and weary early-spring
evening which marked the finish of a bleak
and soulless day. Searching vaguely, however,
among recollections which had left impression
without form, he remembered that people often
did fall silent at the late fulfilment of a long
desire....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Instead of speaking, she sighed. It was such
a sigh, he thought, as the dying give just before
they pass on into new life. In that last breath
there is everything that they see before them,
and everything that they leave behind. Mattie’s
sigh was like that.</p>

<p>Not that she looked like dying, as she got
to her feet at last, heavily a little, but pushing
her chair from her more quietly than usual,
not in the almost rough way she used sometimes,
as if the very furniture of the house clogged
and held her ardent spirit. She stood beside
him a moment, looking down at the letter he
had just written, a splendid woman, growing
old,—and older in the evenings than in the
mornings,—but still full of vitality and fire.
Again he expected her to break out into some
form of expression, either of satisfaction or
relief, but still she said nothing. Sometimes,
as he knew, on occasions of this kind, relief
took the form of a recapitulation of past miseries,
and he would not have been surprised if Mattie
had shown hers in that fashion. But dumbness
seemed to have fallen upon her. Even her face
had grown strangely inexpressive. There was
no hint in it that she was thinking either of old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
sorrow or new joy. It was simply blank, as if
it was no longer able to register the workings
of the mind that lay behind it.</p>

<p>Turning away from him, she moved almost
aimlessly across the kitchen. It was as if she had
been switched suddenly on to another plane,
and did not know any longer what to do on this.
Stooping, she put out her hand for the poker,
as if meaning to stir the fire, but she put it
out to the wrong side. That seemed to paralyse
her more than ever. She seemed incapable of
reaching across to it where it stood in its accustomed
place, but remained stooping, her
hand dropped loosely at her side. It was only
after a long pause that she straightened herself
slowly, and, swinging round, stared about the
room with eyes which hardly seemed to recognise
it.</p>

<p>He continued to watch her, fascinated. It
was all so <i>different</i>, he was saying to himself;
not in the least what he had expected. If only
she would speak!... It couldn’t be that
she was disappointed?—he found himself
thinking, startled; and suddenly there came
into his mind the absurd fear that, in giving
her what she wanted, he had perhaps taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
away from her something that she wanted
more....</p>

<p>She moved away from the hearth, and as she
did so the firelight shot up, so that her shadow
on the wall shot up, too, and became huge and
menacing in the kitchen. Too big for the room,
it pressed itself against ceiling and walls, as if
trying to force a way out of what was no longer
able to contain it. He watched it struggle for
a moment, saw it sink and leap in a still more
furious effort, and then the fire dropped and it
dropped with it. He waited for it to shoot up
again, expecting every second to see it beat and
battle afresh. But it did not shoot up again.
Instead, there came presently into the stillness
a little tinkling sound which showed that the
fire had dropped still lower.</p>

<p>The window of the cottage had long since
gone black, making a dark velvet background
for the gold flower of the lamp at his elbow.
The gardens outside were as blank as Mattie’s
face, gone out as completely as if it was only
in the daytime that they had any concrete
existence. The letter on the table looked a
white, untouched square, with the impress of
his handwriting barely visible upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>There was very little in the letter, but it had
taken a long time to put it down. They had
been so long over it, indeed, that already it was
time for bed. The kitchen clock told them
that, breaking the silence almost impertinently,
and Mattie started. And then she, too, broke
silence.</p>

<p>“Eh, well! So that’s the end of that!”
she said, from the stairfoot, speaking apparently
not so much to him as to a hundred other things
about her; and, turning determinedly towards
the stairs without further comment, mounted
them with her strong though heavy step, and
vanished.</p>

<p>He sat still for some time after she had
gone, feeling a little defrauded and more than
a little exasperated. Even now, when she had
spoken, her voice had told him nothing. It
was rather unfair, he said to himself.... It
seemed incredible that the great moment of her
life should have come and gone, and that she
should have had so few words,—and none too
comprehensible words, either,—with which to
greet it.</p>

<p>But she was glad,—he did not need telling
that; so glad, perhaps, that only tears could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
really express her gladness. Probably she was
crying upstairs, even now, weeping the tears
which it is better not to stop. Because it was
wiser to let her weep he stayed on where he
was, watching the night deepen over the gardens
and droop closer upon his cottage.</p>

<p>He was glad, too, he said to himself; relieved,
too, even though he did not feel inclined to weep
about it. He felt instead that lightness which
comes with choice after a long and difficult
approach to a parting of the ways. He told
himself as he waited that he had only hesitated
until now because he knew that the moment
had not arrived. He had hesitated and rebelled,
and therefore he had suffered; but he did not
suffer now. On the contrary, in this curious,
almost unbelievable way, he actually felt glad.</p>

<p>He got up, after a while, and on a sudden
impulse went and opened the house-door. He
knew that the gardens were there, the moment
he did that. It was only through the window
that they seemed to have faded away. He could
feel them stretching about him on either hand;
could see, without knowing how he saw, the
actual shapes of bed and tree. But to-night
he felt no thrilling link with the place which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
had been in his charge for the last forty years.
He had passed on, as Mattie had long ago
passed on. He had written the letter, and he
was glad.</p>

<p>Without being conscious that he had done
so, he left the door still open when he went
upstairs to bed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE letter was still there when he came
down....</p>

<p>He had known that it would be there, of
course,—had, indeed, lain awake half the night,
thinking about it,—but he was surprised to see
it, nevertheless. More and more, as he thought,
it had taken upon itself the quality of a dream;
so that, when he saw it again, a white shape set
upon an expanse of red-clothed kitchen table,
it met him with a shock.</p>

<p>He put it away from him, however, at once.
After that first glance, which was not so much
a glance as an actual physical encounter thrust
upon him as he came in, he did not look at it
again. But he was aware of it even while he
refused to recognise it. He ignored it, indeed,
with something of the self-conscious effort
with which one ignores a vivid human presence,
going about his tasks as if under actual human
eyes. That he was oppressed by it was evident
from the way in which he flung the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
wide and the door wider, as if in an attempt
to get rid of something which threatened to
take up its permanent abode.</p>

<p>For this morning he was not quite so sure
that he was glad....</p>

<p>Lighting the fire, he set the kettle to boil,
afterwards going into the shadowy little larder
to look for milk. His wife would be awake
before long, and he would take her up a cup of
tea as soon as the kettle permitted. Both he
and Mattie were getting on in years,—he
seventy and she sixty-nine—but they were
able to do for themselves yet. It was a good
thing, he said to himself, considering all that
lay before them, that they were able to do for
themselves yet.... He said it to himself
more than once as he found a cup and saucer
and the sugar that Mattie loved; passing about
the house with the careless precision of practice,
as well as with something more,—the delicate,
kindly step of one accustomed to move in narrow
and crowded places, and among fragile things
like flowers.</p>

<p>And never once did he look at the letter.</p>

<p>The kettle was slow in boiling, for the fire
burnt lazily, this morning. Fires were sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
things, people said, which knew when those who
lighted them were in trouble.... He checked
himself guiltily when he found himself thinking
that, because of course there was no trouble.
On the contrary, there was a great deal of happiness
ahead, as well as excitement and adventure
and reunion and new life. The last especially
appealed to him, because, as head gardener at
Ings Hall, he was continually bringing new life
into existence. It was surely always a wonderful
thing to be about to greet new life!</p>

<p>Mattie would think it wonderful, at all
events, in spite of her wordlessness last night.
She had continued to keep silence even when
he had joined her upstairs, and as he had refrained
from looking at her, in his delicate,
sensitive way, he would never know now
whether or not she had cried. But while he
had lain awake she had slept peacefully,—peacefully,
silently, graciously,—slept as he had
hardly ever known her to sleep, for she was too
active a woman, both in body and mind, to
sleep very well. Indeed, for months before
the letter came to be written, she had hardly
slept at all.... But last night she had slept
as those sleep who for years have felt themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
to be behind bars, until the time comes at last
when they lie down with relaxed limbs and
smooth brows, knowing themselves free.</p>

<p>It was a great thing, of course, to be free.
Mattie had said it so often that he supposed it
must be true. He supposed it, just as he supposed
that he himself was not free, because she
had said that so often, too. He had never
been able really to understand what she meant,
because he could not think of a freer life than
one spent among trees and fruit and flowers.
But she must know better than he did what
freedom meant, because she had thought about
it so much. Talked about it so much, too,
year in and year out.... Yes, it was a great
thing to be free.</p>

<p>The day coming in at the door was going to
be a fine one, he saw, although he had known
that, indeed, as soon as he opened his eyes.
But it was a shrouded day as yet, with the mist
still high above the river, and threaded in and
out among the woods which surrounded the
gardens. In any case, he could not have seen
either the river or the Hall, for they were a
hundred feet below, but even his usual glimpse
of the fells across the valley, beautifully vignetted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
by the stems of larch and beech, was hidden
from him by the mist.</p>

<p>It was very quiet in his special domain on its
steep little hill,—very quiet and very shut-in.
There were the walls round it, first, the big,
mellow, kitchen-garden walls, and then there
were the mist and the trees, and then there was
more mist again. The men had not yet come
to work, and there was not even the sound of
an approaching footstep. The sun had not yet
broken through, bringing with it that sense of
movement which is largely the play of light
and shade. Only the birds were awake and
beginning the day in their usual rushing way;
and the river, which never slept at all, but ran
and talked all night.</p>

<p>It was quiet in the house, too, except for the
lazy crackle of the idle fire, and the loud, determined
strokes of the tactless clock. Mattie, he
knew, must be still asleep, for if she had stirred
he would have heard the bed creak in the room
above. Even if she had not stirred he would
have known if she was awake, for her vitality
would have flowed down through the house and
touched him as if with an actual hand.</p>

<p>He loved the quietness. He loved being shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
in on the top of his hill, and would have been
only the better pleased if there had been thirty
barriers about him instead of three. This was
the time when the place was wholly his, before
his staff stirred in the bothy or climbed the
hill from the park. The men, when they came,
had an air of possession even in their tread,
and in the way they handled things and struck
spades into the soil. It was natural, of course,
but he felt that it robbed him a little. He had
to share the gardens with them. His employers
had the possessive air, too, although not so
much as the men, both because they knew their
place better and because they did not strike
tools into the ground. But he had to share
the gardens with them, all the same. They
said: “What are you going to grow just here,
Kirkby?” Or: “Don’t you think we might
have so-and-so, this year, instead of this-and-that?”
So they robbed him, too.</p>

<p>Not that he was one of those jealous gardeners
who grudge the stuff they grow even to the
people for whom they grow it. He was not
foolish about the gardens, or greedy in any way.
He grew things for a purpose, and he liked them
to fulfil that purpose. Only he <i>was</i> the gardens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
so to speak, after all these years, and when
anything was taken from them it was part of
him that was taken away.</p>

<p>He was certainly <i>like</i> a garden, as he stood
at his house-door, looking out. When most
people open their doors and stare, the things
outside come awake, but they took no notice of
Kirkby. The gardens, as it were, did not even
look up. They were no more disturbed by his
appearance than by one of their own shadows
lying under the bushes, or by the long, ghostly
lines of the green and crystal hoar-frost.</p>

<p>He was old and gentle, like an English garden,
but he was hale, too, and not by any means run
to seed. His clothes, good clothes, now
pleasantly shabby, had a mellow tone which
blended softly with their setting. His fresh
complexion and faded but clear eyes had the
pale tints of some of his own blossoms. The
very droop of his shoulders was less like the
slow curve which comes with age than the
gentle stoop of a flower.</p>

<p>Especially he loved the quietness because it
was at this hour that he had a vision of the
gardens as he planned them for the year. This
was his creative time, these few moments before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the men came and broke and scattered his
thoughts. It was then that he saw the long
succession of colours and kinds with which the
gardens would sum up their rich total before
the winter came again. He would lose some of
it later, of course, owing to other people’s
follies and fancies, and the stolid frustration of
concrete facts. But some of it would persist,
even through worries and contradictions and
the hard blows of the northern weather; so
that, by the time the resting-months for the
gardens came round once more, he would
always in some measure have fulfilled his dream.</p>

<p>He was not always able to snatch these god-like
moments in which he controlled the future.
Often enough, Mattie was downstairs first, and
he could not call up his pictures while she was
working and talking. Husbands and wives
were so near to each other that they got in each
other’s way over things like those,—things that
had to have you all to themselves, or they would
not come. But he always took his moments
when he could get them, because he needed
them. His days were poorer without them and
the assurance they brought him, as days are
poorer without a prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>And just now was the time when the vision
was strongest and clearest, when there was
promise of new life all around, and still it was
only promise. Like all artists, he saw his
creation best when there was still nothing but
a blank page in front of him. It had then a
clarity, a sweep, a combined passion and restraint
which it never achieved again after he
had once begun to work upon it. It altered,
no matter how he tried to preserve it. Alien
ideas crept in, upsetting the balance of his
scheme. Beautiful ideas they were, too, sometimes,
but they were alien, nevertheless. Often
he had tried to convince himself that the altered
plan was all for the best; but as soon as the
springtime both of the gardens and of his inspiration
came round again, he knew that the thing
which he saw then was the finer and purer.</p>

<p>The whole panorama of the seasons passed
in colour and shape before his inward eye,
running at the same time through his brain
like a well-known piece of music. Familiar
as it was, however, it was also highly intricate,
with its many different parts overlapping and
intertwining. Not only was there the kitchen garden
to think of, but there were the glass-houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
as well, fruit grown inside and out,
tomatoes, orchids, carnations, violets. Then
down at the Hall there were the rose-gardens
and lawns, tennis-courts and flower-borders,
and the long yew and beech-hedges to be kept
trim and close. And besides all these there was
the big rock-garden across the river, full of
plants which, however much you might suppress
them, grew as giants grow in a single night.</p>

<p>He saw the vegetables he would grow with
the warm, homely thrill with which the farmer
sees his crops, and the housewife her stores of
linen and jam. The fruit he saw as an artist
sees his finished task,—as gleaming jewels of
price which you can hold and weigh in your
hand. But the flowers he saw as the mystic
and the dreamer see Heaven,—not in concrete
form, but as sheer colour and light, and an
ecstasy of shaded tones.</p>

<p>He had, too, the knowledge which enabled
him to see under the soil, as the geologist sees
the strata under his feet, and the drainer sees
where the streams run under the apparently
dry surface. Beneath the quiet beds and the
still grass he saw the forces of life already waking
to work, sending the spring-urge through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
seeds which had slept there during the winter,
or conserving their energies for those which
should be given into their charge later.</p>

<p>But for that insight and knowledge there
would have seemed little enough encouragement
from the brown waste lying before him, and
curving away behind potting-sheds and glass
to come back to him again along empty borders.
The gardens were not actually empty, of course,
for there were evergreen climbers and shrubs,
patches of colour made by the remains of the
winter greens, jasmine in flower, and the wing-like
flashes of snowdrops and crocuses. But
by comparison with his vision it was altogether
desolate and barren, for in that he saw all the
miracle of each season at once, smiled upon by
a cloudless heaven.</p>

<p>First—and this he always saw first, and
indeed it was already hard upon the heels of
his vision—he saw the crimson <i>ribes</i> glowing
over the countryside, that precious pink flame
which appears so suddenly and amazingly
among the pale yellows of the spring. Then—a
quieter beauty, but equally as thrilling—the
infinitely pure green that comes creeping over
the brown thorn. He saw the purples of lilac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and iris, the cool white and green of lily-of-the-valley,
the vivid yet delicate spirit-stains of the
azalea. He saw red and white jewels hung by
the thousand on raspberry canes and currant
bushes, and the creamy ovals of new potatoes.
He saw roses, not singly, but in arches and flung
handfuls, and a cloud of sweet peas like pinioned
butterflies. Backing it all he saw green again,
the young live green of the early spring, and
the deep, sap-running green of the flush of
summer. But above all he saw blue, that colour
so precious in a northern county which is kept
short of blue skies. Lupins and forget-me-not
and delphiniums and periwinkle, and the
blue that is never quite blue of the hydrangea.
When he looked across the gardens it was chiefly
blue that he saw,—blue against the brown of
the soil and the green of the shrubs and the
mist-wrapped sepia of the wet tree-trunks.</p>

<p>Not every other gardener, he found, had the
passion for blue to anything like the extent that
he had. All of them grew blue flowers, of course,
filling their borders with them, and flinging
them profusely about their rockeries. But they
did not worship them, as he did,—did not wait
and watch for them, feeling, as they looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
them, that what they looked at was pure spirit.
Mostly they preferred deep-coloured roses
and rich carnations, the tawny hues of chrysanthemums
or the flaming shades of rhododendrons
and dahlias. They did not seem to
see the wistfulness of blue against a northern
landscape, and how it was answered by the
smoke-blue of far-off mountains and the steel-blue
of frozen tarns.</p>

<p>This year, however, they were to have a new
blue flower which had attracted quite a lot of
attention at a northern show, last summer.
It had been brought into being by a north-country
horticulturist, and so naturally the
northern papers had made a great to-do about it.
One of them had said that the new “dawnbell,”
as it was called, had a certain quality which
only a northern mind could have infused into
it; and another said that it seemed to contain
all the fundamental blues of the world, as the
rose seemed to contain all the fundamental
pinks. Kirkby had not quite understood what
either of the papers was talking about, but it
did not matter. All that he knew, as he paid
his homage to the dawnbell in its airless tent,
was that, set against the background of his fells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
at home, it would have the exquisiteness and
the appeal of a little child.</p>

<p>But not only did he see the glory of the garden
unrolled before him; he saw the daily work,
the infinite pains which led to the production of
it. He saw the trenching, the sowing, the thinning,
the potting and pruning, the staking and
tying, the watering and weeding. He saw the
daily fight with the myriad living creatures
which strive to share the results of man’s
labours with him. And when he had finished
with the growing, there was still the cropping,
the gathering for the Hall, the London house,
the shooting-box, the market. And when the
heaviest work in that way was beginning to
get over, there was the layering and manuring
and dividing; and always the continual battle
for order with the leaf-storms flung upon him
by the autumn gales.</p>

<p>Not that he saw this side of his vision as
mere drudgery, or in any way secondary to the
rest. It was all one to him, indeed, and of
equal interest and beauty, for to the artist the
craft is as fascinating as the dream. <i>He</i> knew,
who had done every job in a garden in his time,
the contentment that may wait upon a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
when he is working out even the smallest detail
of a great conception. Long ago he had learned
that the whole is implicit in the part; so that,
while he broke his way through stiff soil, or
toiled patiently with the knife, he felt his
material quiver with the message of all that was
yet to come, and saw, not the apparently trivial
task upon which he was engaged, but the beauty
that should be.</p>

<p>He was so still during the few minutes in
which his vision passed before him that the
very bushes and trees, chained and weighted
with heavy drops, seemed by comparison to be
full of animation. It was as if the actual life
were being drained out of him in order to supply
vitality to the temporarily vivid picture. The
light had brightened a little, and the mist was
lifting. Far below, from the direction of the
park, a sweet-whistled snatch swam up to him
through the mist as the faint chimes of sunk
church-bells are said to swim up through the
sea. The men were coming to work. Behind
him the kettle boiled over with a sudden angry
hiss, and at the same moment he heard the bed
creak in the room above.</p>

<p>Turning, he saw the letter....</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE again, however, he shut it out, firmly
refusing to look at it as he stepped across
to the kettle. Yet again his awareness of it
was apparent in his every movement. His
hand shook as he made the tea; and when the
bed upstairs creaked again, with that sharp,
emphatic creak which he had come to regard
as actually emanating from his wife rather than
as the mere protest of a piece of furniture, he
hurried out of the room as if thankful to get
away from it.</p>

<p>Cup in hand, he went upstairs, and entered
the low bedroom, with its window looking out
on to the little plot of ground which was private
to the house, separated from the rest of the
gardens by a privet hedge which he had planted
forty years ago, and which had now grown thick
and high. He had never ceased to feel surprised
when he looked at that hedge, not because
it had done so well, but because it was there at
all. He would never have thought of planting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
it but for his wife, because it would never have
occurred to him to feel the need of it. Either
the whole place was his, or else none of it was,—that
was how he looked at it. Nevertheless,
he had planted the hedge to please her, because
she wanted a spot where she could “get away.”
In the same way she had chosen the bedroom
which looked out on that particular side, because
it made her feel that she “wasn’t there.” He
had had some difficulty in understanding either
of these rather puzzling statements, but he
had made no bones about them. He himself
had never wanted either to get away or to feel
that he wasn’t there; but of course it wasn’t
to be expected that he and Mattie should always
feel the same.</p>

<p>She was sitting up in bed when he went in,
and leaning forward a little, as if some eagerness
in her had sent her spirit before her to unburden
itself to him. The paralysis which had seemed
to afflict her on the previous night,—the result,
perhaps, of over-emotion or fatigue—had completely
dropped from her. This morning,
indeed, she looked alive to her very finger-tips.
Her strong, buxom figure looked hale and wholesome
in its good longcloth nightgown. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
plaited hair, run through with silver, was still
silky and thick. Her eyes were shining and her
cheeks flushed. She took the cup from him in
a grasp that was as firm and capable as when he
had first known her.</p>

<p>“Eh, but I’ve slept sound!” she announced,
yawning and smiling in a breath, while the
vibrant tones of her voice, running through the
room, seemed to stir up the atmosphere of the
house, and even to assist at the awakening of
the world outside. “I don’t know that I ever
remember sleeping like that before.”</p>

<p>He nodded, looking at her affectionately as he
stood beside the bed in one of those still attitudes
of his which suggested the poise of a flower on
a windless day.</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ve slept grand. You were tired,
likely, with all that settling and such-like.”</p>

<p>She laughed at that, showing teeth that were
still fine, and stirring her tea with a steady hand.</p>

<p>“Nay, not I!” she said in the same voice,
the very strength of which was an added denial.
“It’d take a deal more than that to knock me
out.” Then suddenly she sobered, staring
thoughtfully at the cup before her. “I was
just sort of—satisfied—I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>He said: “That’s right! That’ll be it,” in
his quiet tones, nodding at her again, although
this time she wasn’t looking at him; the little
action and the repeated phrase seeming to
warn off something inside him that was making
him feel guilty.</p>

<p>“I was dreaming a deal, although I was so
sound....” She lifted her eyes to him once
more in their shining eagerness. “I dreamt
I was There!”</p>

<p>He grew, if possible, a trifle more still. So
far, he had evaded the letter successfully, but
he could not evade this. In another minute,
and in spite of himself, he, too, would be
There....</p>

<p>“I saw the whole spot as plain as plain!”
Mattie went on rapidly. “There was Luke’s
house, first of all, and then Joe’s, and then
Maggie’s and her husband’s,—all nearabouts
together, just as they’ve always said.”</p>

<p>He murmured, “Yes, yes! Yes, yes!”
trying to hold himself back, but feeling that
he was going, all the same.</p>

<p>“Ellen was there, too, though she lives a
good bit off....” She ruminated a little, as
if trying to work out in her mind how Ellen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
had managed it. “It was all just as they said,
only a deal bigger. All of ’em together, just as
they used to be, and things as snug as snug!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>She paused a moment, contentedly sipping
her tea, and staring at the knitted quilt on the
bed as though she saw the whole pattern of her
dream laid out there before her.</p>

<p>“There was another house as well,” she said
presently, still staring,—“a house you and me
know of, as isn’t built yet, but will be, before
long....”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>“And between the houses there was that
garden they talk so much about,—a great big
stretch of a place as seemed to go on for ever
and ever.”</p>

<p>He did not say anything to that, for the
simple reason that he was no longer present to
say it. He was There now, just as she had been
There, all during those night-hours when he had
lain awake and she had slept so sweetly. The
garden had taken him, as he had known it
would take him, if she began to speak of it.
He could fight against all the rest,—the houses
and their occupants, even that other house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
which was going to be so important, although
it was not yet even built; but he could not
fight the garden. The very mention of it was
sufficient to drag him out of the safe place in
which he had lived so long, and to carry him
overseas.</p>

<p>“It was all just as we thought,” Mattie was
saying again,—“only a deal bigger.” She had
forgotten her tea, for the time being, and her
gaze at the quilt seemed not so much to be
seeing pictures upon it as to pierce through it
and beyond. “There was that much room,—more
room than I’d ever thought there was in
the whole world! Even the sky seemed bigger
and higher than our sky over here.” She drew
a deep breath, as if even in imagination it was
a delight to fill her lungs under that higher
and wider sky.... “The children were there
and all,” she went on, after a pause, her voice
softening. “You’ll hardly believe it, but I knew
’em as well as well, even though I’ve never seen
no more of ’em than just their photos! There
was Luke’s Joe, and Joe’s Luke, and little
Sally, and Daisy May; little Eric, too ... and
Maggie’s last, as hasn’t done as well as it should....
I couldn’t have known them better if I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
brought them up myself! And the queerest
thing of all was that they knew <i>me</i>!... Just
before I woke up I told ’em I’d got to go,
and they set to and cried fit to break their
hearts.”</p>

<p>“It was only a dream,” he tried to console
her, speaking with an effort as if from a great
distance.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it wasn’t like dreaming; it was
like <i>being</i>!” she said quickly, and suddenly her
eyes filled with tears. “It was <i>that</i> real!”</p>

<p>He came back then from his leap across the
ocean, and, reaching out his hand, patted her
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’ll be real enough soon,” he reminded
her gently. “It’s only a matter of being
patient a few weeks more.”</p>

<p>“Only a few weeks, that’s all,” she repeated
after him in a curiously childlike fashion,
heartening herself both with the words and with
a sip of the cooling tea. “But it’s a long while,
all the same.... Seems strange, doesn’t it,
you should feel as if you couldn’t wait a few
more weeks, when you’ve waited for years and
years?”</p>

<p>“You won’t notice you’re waiting,” he pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
out. “You’ll be too busy. There’ll be a deal
to do.”</p>

<p>She brightened at that, her vitality mounting
at the very thought of the approaching period
of activity. “Ay, and I’m keen to be at it!”
she retorted briskly. “I shan’t feel it’s really
real until I begin to pack!”</p>

<p>She was launched now upon a subject of
which the possibilities were endless, and was
already deep in its details when the same
whistled snatch reached them which Kirkby
had heard earlier from the park. He moved
automatically. “There’s the men. I must be
off,” he said, turning towards the door.</p>

<p>Mattie nodded, her mind still full of delightful
problems.</p>

<p>“It’s time we were both moving,” she agreed,
though vaguely. “I’m late this morning....
It’s that dream, I suppose,” she added, passing
her hand over her eyes as if to remove something
which still lingered before them, “but I
don’t rightly feel as if I was back!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re back, right enough!” he smiled
at her from the door; and at the words the
thing which had stayed in front of her eyes
fled, and she looked across at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Ay, I’m back,” she said in a curious tone,
and looked away from him and about her.
“Back!”—and her glance went to the privet
hedge beyond the window.... He waited
a moment, staring at her uncertainly and rather
uncomfortably, and then slipped quietly from
the room. Half-way down the stairs, he heard
her say “Back!” again, and hesitated in his
step as if meaning to return to her; only to
hurry on afterwards more rapidly than ever.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS he entered the kitchen he was met by
the letter with the now familiar shock, but
this time he did not attempt to evade it. On
the contrary, he went deliberately across to it,
and stood by the table, looking at it. A glance
at the clock had shown him that he was earlier
than he had imagined, and he was in no mood
to meet his staff before he was obliged. That
whistling first-comer would be Len Machell,
a skilled gardener and his right-hand man.
Len was always early, and he had always liked
him for it; but he was not so sure that he liked
him for it, this morning. Deep down in his
mind lurked an uncomfortable suspicion that
Len had a reason for coming early to-day....</p>

<p>The letter, addressed in his small but flowing
handwriting, was directed to his employer
at the Hall. He was always slightly ashamed of
his pale, delicate script, especially when he
happened to see it beside his wife’s black and
sturdy hand. The scant imprint of the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
seemed almost a purposed reproach to the
brave intensity of the other. It was true that
Mattie, in helping to draft the letter, had used
so much of the ink, writing and re-writing, and
underlining and exclaiming, that there had been
very little of it left by the time he came to
it; but of course that was no excuse. <i>She</i>
would have got her effect, he knew, even with
a dried-up bottle and a broken nib!... He
felt unhappily that his effort looked even feebler
this morning than it had done last night, as if it
had faded for lack of volition on the part of the
writer.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, he said to himself, straightening
himself as he stood, it was his weak pen which
had altered their destinies. Mattie’s handwriting,
superior though it was, could not in this
case have had the weight of his. The ink that
was left had been more than sufficient for the
few, colourless words in which, after forty
years’ service, he had sent in his notice.</p>

<p>It had seemed so impossible a thing before
it was done, and, now that it <i>was</i> done, it seemed
so easy. Simple and easy, as death seemed,
when you saw it close.... But it was wrong
of him to keep on thinking of the change that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
was coming in terms of trouble or death. Once
already that morning he had had to remind
himself that what it really stood for was new
life.</p>

<p>Yet it was only in terms of death, he said to
himself obstinately, that he could think of the
actual break. It seemed absurd that the snapping
of a tie like that could be brought about
by the mere scraping of a rusty pen. It should
be accomplished, he thought, in some more
dramatic way, like the call to attention of clean
shot, and the lowering of something into a grave.</p>

<p>Forty years’ service was in that letter, but
there was so much more besides. He had been
bred on the estate, like his parents before him,
and he had never left it. All that was in it, too.
Old customs and ways of thought, closer and
closer growth to human beings and to the soil,—links
that had loosened and even broken,
but had always welded again,—all these were
there. Not in the actual wording of the letter,
of course, but in its very texture; so that it
seemed as if one man alone could never carry
its weight of association and memory, and its
long tale of the years.</p>

<p>And more besides.... Not only was there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
forty years’ service in the letter, but there was
forty years’ struggle ... all that long contest
between himself and his wife, which had begun
in the first year of their marriage and never
stopped,—never, that is, until last night with
the writing of the letter, when it had stopped
as a clock stops in a house where somebody
dies.</p>

<p>Even this morning he had that same feeling
as of a clock stopped somewhere in the house,
followed as it always was by a silence that
could be heard....</p>

<p>Well, it was all over,—the talks, the disputes,
the discussions as to ways and means. She had
always wanted to go, and he had never been
able to go; first, because he hadn’t the money
and, second, because he hadn’t the heart. He
had grown to believe that the discussions would
go on for ever, and now they were at an end.
It almost seemed as if they would have nothing
to talk about any more.</p>

<p>She had never liked the place from the very
start; never settled or learned to look upon it
as home. He had waited for the years to work
their magic upon her, and they had never worked
it. She had never settled.... Always she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
had gone on longing and reaching out for something
that wasn’t there, something that in the
very nature of things couldn’t possibly be there.</p>

<p>It had taken him a long time to understand,
and he was not sure that he understood, even
yet. All that he had definitely learned from the
clash of wills was that the heart must face its
own way; that one man’s meat may be another
man’s poison, and that the holy, inhabited
place wherein one soul can find its peace may
be nothing but an airless vacuum to another.</p>

<p>Yet it was not, he sometimes argued with
himself, as if he had taken her from such a very
different existence. She was a gardener’s
daughter, as he was a gardener’s son, and had
been born to the same tranquil round and
lovely isolation. He had thought her happy
enough when he saw her at home, cheerful and
busy and making her own interests; but that,
as he knew now, was merely because of her
youth. The soul can lay out its own pleasure-grounds
when it is young. Later, when it
ceases to do so, it sees the little ring-fence
surrounding it only too plainly.</p>

<p>Right up to the time of her wedding, indeed,
Mattie had been so busy, one way and another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
that she had never realised her own requirements.
Even if she had thought about them,
she would have taken it for granted that marriage
would mean a wider life, and instead she
had found life narrow down upon her. Existence
in her native place had been narrow, too, as she
was ready to admit, but not <i>so</i> narrow; for in
the home of one’s youth there is always a way
of escape through the magic door of childhood.</p>

<p>It was tragic that she had not known that she
needed a wider scope,—tragic for both of them.
But she had not known, and there had been
nobody—apparently—to tell her. It was the
gardens which told her eventually,—his dear,
charmed circle of the gardens,—when it was
too late.</p>

<p>He had found her, one evening,—as very
soon after their marriage he had come to look
for her,—sitting beside an upstairs window.
The window was open, and by putting out her
head she could see between the trunks of the
trees to the coloured canvases of the fells. It
was a circumscribed view at the best, with only
a section of the hills visible when the weather
permitted, together with a strip of sky laid
nun-wise across their foreheads; but it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
better than nothing. He had called up to her
laughingly to ask her “what she was at,” and
she had told him in reply that she was “shoving
the walls away.”</p>

<p>“Shoving what walls? And whatever for?”
he had enquired, puzzled, and she had flung
out her hands with a thrusting movement
towards the walls surrounding the gardens.</p>

<p>“<i>Them</i> walls!” she had said vehemently.
“They make me feel sort of choked. There’s
times I feel I could hag ’em down with my own
hands, brick by brick!”</p>

<p>He had been so surprised by that that he had
stayed under the window, staring, and wondering
whether she wasn’t well, or whether something
had happened to upset her. It seemed
incredible to him that people should think of
garden walls as shutting them in, when everybody
knew that what they were really there for
was to shut things and people out.</p>

<p>“What, there was walls at home, wasn’t
there?” he reminded her, at last. “Ay, and
a deal higher than ours, too, now I come to
think of it!”</p>

<p>It had been her turn to stare, then, turning
the problem over in her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“I never thought of ’em as high,” she returned
slowly, pondering. “Anyway, I never
felt shut in. Likely it was just because things
seem that much bigger and wider to a child,
but I remember thinking the garden was nearabouts
as big as the whole world!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not saying this here’s quite as
big as that!” he had tried to laugh her out of
her brooding. “But it’s a fairish size. You’ll
not find a better kitchen-spot anywhere in the
North.”</p>

<p>“It’s terribly shut-in, all the same,” she persisted
obstinately. “And terribly small. <i>That</i>
small,” she added suddenly, with a characteristic
flash which might have stood equally for
bitterness or humour, “I could happen put
it inside my wedding-ring!”</p>

<p>It had grown no bigger for her, either, as
time went on. She had never ceased to find it
small and shut-in, never ceased to rebel against
its limitations. Many a day she had sat by the
upstairs window during the years that followed,
but she had never succeeded in pushing the walls
away. It was he who had done it in the end by
writing the letter, laying them flat with his pen
as effectively as with any Jericho trumpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Still, it was her will that ran behind the pen,
even though it was his hand that held it. He
knew that well enough, even while his loyalty
had no intention of admitting it. The disputes
and discussions had seemed futile enough at the
time, but they had done their work in the end.
Her hours of silent revolt, equally with her
passionate clamourings to be free, had accumulated
at last into a dynamic force which seemed
able to move mountains.</p>

<p>Once, before, indeed, she had almost succeeded
in getting her way, only to find, just as
she was on the point of turning into it, that it
led to a dead end. The affair was so long ago
now that he had practically forgotten it, but it
came back to him, this morning. Contemplating
it to-day, he was struck by one curious fact,—that
what he had nearly done then seemed to
him now far more incredible than what he had
actually done, last night. The sudden reassertion
of that distant point of view showed
him how much he had altered since that date;
how far he had travelled, although unknowingly,
along the road to Mattie’s desire.</p>

<p>It was at a local flower-show that the opportunity
had come, tumbled from Heaven, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
seemed, in answer to Mattie’s pleading. He
had been present at the show in the capacity of
judge, and a visiting landowner had taken a
fancy to him. At the end of the afternoon, his
new friend, without actually offering him the
post, had yet managed to convey to him that
his own head gardener’s situation, which happened
to be vacant at the moment, could be
Kirkby’s for the mere formality of asking.</p>

<p>He had forgotten the incident, as has been
said, but at least he had no difficulty in remembering
how his wife had taken the news. It
had acted upon her like a charm, turning her,
even at the mere prospect of escape, into a
different creature, so that already she moved
and spoke as if breathing a freer air. All
evening they had debated the question, and had
gone up to bed resolved upon accepting the
unspoken invitation. He recalled Mattie’s
elation over their luck, her gratitude to Providence,
her almost childlike happiness. Yet it
was he who had slept, that night, even under
the sword of impending change; while she,
for all that her prayer was about to be granted,
had lain awake.</p>

<p>And in the morning the whole of her evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
dream had fallen to pieces.... She had come
downstairs silent and apathetic, dimmed as a
candle is dimmed by the coming of daylight.
She ignored any reference on his part to the
decision of the night before, and when he definitely
tried to reopen the subject, she pushed it
away. Later, when he insisted that the matter
should be settled, one way or the other, she told
him that she had given up all idea of leaving.</p>

<p>“It’d make no difference, even if we did go,”
she had said dully. “I didn’t see it, first thing,
but I do now. It’d be the same thing over
again, that’s all, and happen worse.”</p>

<p>His heart had leaped in spite of him at the
unexpected reprieve, but he had tried to
encourage her, nevertheless.</p>

<p>“What, it’ll be a fresh spot, anyhow!” he
reminded her bravely. “That’s something,
surely? Fresh folks and a fresh house, as well
as a different sort of air, as’ll likely suit you
better.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“It’d only look fresh on the outside. It
wouldn’t <i>be</i> fresh in any way as really
mattered.”</p>

<p>“If it’s the walls as is still bothering you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
they’ve no call to, as I’ve told you already. The
house at the new spot is outside the gardens
altogether. I asked Colonel Brangwyn special.”</p>

<p>But she refused to be heartened.</p>

<p>“It’d be the same thing over again,” was all
she would say, repeating herself endlessly.
“Just exactly the same. You and me and the
gardens, and me choking myself to death.”</p>

<p>“What is it you <i>do</i> want, d’you think?”
he had asked her at last patiently, and she had
shaken her head again, looking away from him
almost shyly.</p>

<p>“Nay, I don’t know. I’m daft, I suppose.
It’s just <i>room</i>.... Ay, well, it’s no use talking
about it any more. But you needn’t apply for
Colonel Brangwyn’s.”</p>

<p>Much the same situation had recurred at
intervals, later on, but it had always ended in
the same way. Always she had drawn back
again at the last moment. Always it had seemed
to her that she had found the right road at last,
only to realise that it led nowhere. Always she
had seen in time that, no matter where she went,
to this country-house or that, she would always
have the little ring of an English garden round
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Things had been better for her after the
children began to come, but they had also
been worse. The gardens had grown fuller
for her, after their arrival, but they had grown
no larger. Moreover, the increasing family
had put a stop to any chance of retirement as
well as to the occasionally-discussed project
of “setting up for ourselves.” Money had
continually grown tighter. With each fresh
child that appeared, they were forced to “plough
a furrow nearer the fence.”</p>

<p>Yet if it was the children who in the first
instance had closed the door to escape, it was
the children who in the long run had thrown it
open. One by one, as they grew up, they had
all of them left the gardens. They had loved
them,—all, perhaps, except Ellen,—just as
they loved their parents; but they had left
them, nevertheless. Something of their mother’s
longing for space must have entered into them
at birth, making it impossible for them to
remain. And not only had they found the
gardens too small, but England itself, so that
they had allowed Canada to swallow them up,
as it swallowed so many.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before they began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
to regret this wholesale snapping of ties. Not
only did they get together as soon as possible
on the other side, but, the moment they were
on their feet, they wrote, urging their parents
to join them. Sometimes it was Luke who
wrote, and sometimes Joe; Maggie, sometimes,
and sometimes Ellen. Later on, when they
were all married, the boys’ wives wrote, too,
and the girls’ husbands; and, later still, it was
the grandchildren who, with their first handling
of a pen, added their unsteady scrawls to the
general petition.</p>

<p>It was really the grandchildren who had
beaten him in the end....</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL the same, a long time had elapsed
before he had finally given in. He was
middle-aged and over even when the letters
first began to come, and he had not felt able to
face the venture. Mattie was all agog for it,
of course, seeing it as the chance for which she
had waited all her life, but he refused to consider
it. He had said “no” so often, indeed,
that it had seemed as if he could go on saying it
for ever. But he had not gone on saying it for
ever, or anything like it. Quite suddenly he
had blotted out all those accumulated “noes”
with a single “yes.”</p>

<p>Yet, perhaps, now that he came to think of it,
it had not been as sudden as he imagined. It
seemed to him now, looking back, that the
“noes” had had no significance at all; that, in
point of fact, he had been defeated from the very
start. Right from that first occasion upon which
he had found his wife upstairs, pushing the walls
away, he had known that he would go....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Nevertheless, for ten years at least he had
successfully resisted both Mattie’s persuasions
and the calls from over the sea. It seemed
extraordinary to him now that he should have
been able to hold out so long. But then it was
not he himself that had been able to hold out,
but something outside him,—something that
would not break, that never <i>could</i> have broken,
so he had firmly believed, until it had given
way on the previous evening.</p>

<p>Still, it had not been an easy matter, keeping
his ears and his heart shut, all those years.
Not only were there Mattie’s arguments to
contend with, and of course the letters, but
there was a constant succession of photographs
as well. Snapshots of the party across the
ocean were always arriving,—pictures of his
children, of their wives and husbands, their
homes, their families. And besides all these
there were photographs of the nursery garden
which they ran among them, and which they
were rapidly turning into a big business. For
in this one thing at least they had remained
true to type. Without hesitation they had
turned naturally and successfully to gardening.</p>

<p>At first he had felt little more for their far-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
efforts than the aloof if kindly contempt of the
finished workman for the crude beginner. He
was glad, of course, that the children had kept
to the old trade, but conditions were different
“out there,” and at first he found them
difficult to follow. As time went on, however,
and the photographs showed the garden to be
increasing in size and scope, his interest began
to quicken. He had it fixed in his mind now
what they were planting and when, and what
they were growing for the different markets.
Presently he was even trying some of their new-fangled
ideas on his own account, although he
was careful not to say very much about them.
Thinking about that distant garden while he
worked in his own, he came at last to that
point where the mind passes so easily between
place and place that the body might equally
well be in either.</p>

<p>Mattie, of course, had reached that particular
state long since. Her dream of last night had
been only a vivid extension of it. Often, for
instance, she would talk of the grandchildren
as if they were no further away than round the
corner. “Little Joe’s first day at school to-day,”
she would say, bending over her sewing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
“I hope they got him off in good time.” Or— “Maggie’s
May’s not so grand with that cough
of hers. I must see about getting her a bottle
of something from the chemist’s.”</p>

<p>He had done his best to conceal from her
his growing absorption in the Canadian enterprise,
but it was not long before she discovered it.
Dropping her talk of the grandchildren to some
extent, she concentrated upon the business,
surprising him, times without number, by her
intimate knowledge of it. She, who had never
shown even the faintest enthusiasm for his
particular job, seemed to know every seed that
was sown in that nursery across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Potatoes have done well for them, this year,”
she would inform him, glibly reeling off a list
of varieties. “‘Grand Elephant’s’ the best,
though, they say. I’d like to try ’em. That
sort we had ourselves wasn’t worth the planting.”</p>

<p>“Main crop <i>was</i> ‘Grand Elephants,’” he
would remind her mildly, but without arousing
her to any excitement.</p>

<p>“Eh, now! Fancy that!” she would answer,
in a tone of polite wonder. “And I never
knew!... Likely it’s the soil or something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
as makes the difference. Anyhow, all I can say
is I thought ’em right poor.”</p>

<p>For some time she had contented herself
with merely stimulating his increasing interest,
but after a while she came out into the open
with it as a weapon.</p>

<p>“You’d settle sharp enough, you’d see,” she
was saying presently, when the eternal subject
came cropping up again. “It’s the same job,
when all’s said. ’Tisn’t as if you’d be going to
something different.”</p>

<p>“It’d <i>be</i> different, though, in lots of ways,”
he had replied firmly, much in the same hopeless
but obstinate tone in which she had so
often asserted that “it would be just the same.”
“Come to that,” he had added with spirit,
“I wonder you’re so keen on it yourself if it’s
not to be fresh, seeing you’ve always been so set
against gardening and such-like?”</p>

<p>She had laughed without resentment at his
mild attack, too enchanted with her happy
project to be stirred to anger.</p>

<p>“It’d be different in <i>my</i> way,” she admitted,—“I
give you that—but I don’t know as it’d
be that much different in yours. It’d be bigger-freer—nay,
I can’t explain! But sticking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
things into the ground and taking them out
again seems to me much the same job all the
world over.”</p>

<p>He had said nothing to that, partly because
it did not seem worth while, but also because
his mind instinctively retreated when she
mentioned size. She liked to think of the
Canadian garden as prairie-wide, a great,
untrammelled stretch of a place under an arching
sky,—but that view of it repelled him. The
photographs, of course, had shown him something
of what it was like, but he chose to ignore
them. Hidden away in his imagination was his
own impression of the place, as a time-mellowed,
sheltered circle of anciently-tilled soil....</p>

<p>It was perhaps because he had been dwelling
upon the garden in that particular guise that
yesterday he had given in. Also he had had
an annoying day, spoilt by several of those tiresome
little incidents able even to take the
glamour out of the work which is nearest to
one’s heart. But it was chiefly the weather
which had overset his mind, hard and clear as
it was with that sinister hardness and clearness
which scarifies the soul. It was the only weather
that ever made him feel really old, stripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
as it did the veils from his various shrines. He
had gone indoors for his evening meal, feeling
that his life, under its present conditions, had
nothing further to offer him.</p>

<p>The mail was in, he found, as he sat down,—it
had seemed to him, of late years, that the mail
was always in,—and a letter from Canada was
lying on the table. Mattie had opened it,
apparently, and presumably read it, but she
made no attempt to force it upon his notice.
She neither mentioned it, indeed, nor even as
much as pushed it towards him, and perhaps
because of this lack of coercion, he found himself
eyeing it longingly. In his momentary
state of depression it seemed to offer him the
exact stimulant which he needed, and after
resisting the impulse for a short time, he reached
out and drew it towards him.</p>

<p>The atmosphere changed around him almost
as soon as he opened the letter. Canada leaped
out of the pages at him as he read,—Canada,
live and free, and with red blood rushing in its
veins. It had always seemed to him a country
where everybody was young, and to-day more
than ever it seemed peopled with radiant youth.
The letter was full of vitality, of hope, of healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
happiness and success. He forgot his annoyances
as he read, and his depression vanished.
By the time he had finished the letter he, too,
felt young, breathing the air of that land which
seemed to know nothing of growing old....</p>

<p>The garden was in the letter, too, needless to
say; in fact, it might almost be said that it
was more garden than letter. It was almost
as if the writer had posted a piece of the actual
soil.... Kirkby, holding it in his earth-sensitive
hand, found it an amulet transporting
him so far that he lost all sense of his present
surroundings.</p>

<p>He looked up after a time to find his wife’s
gaze fixed upon him, and the teapot suspended
in her hand. Apparently she had been about
to speak, and then had been checked by a
realisation of the importance of the moment.
He stared at her as if he found some difficulty
in focussing her, and she lowered the teapot
slowly to the table.... He tapped the letter.</p>

<p>“Mattie,” he said. “We’d likely best
go....”</p>

<p>It was really the garden which had beaten
him in the end.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">V</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE came back from re-tracing the slow
trend which had led to the writing of the
letter to find Machell staring at his open doorway
from across the garden. From that
distance, as he knew, the man could see nothing
of what was happening inside; yet he bestirred
himself sharply and moved away from the table.
Len’s attitude affected him unpleasantly, just
as his coming early had done; so that, when he
went out at last to join him and give him his
orders for the day, he had an uncomfortable
feeling that this morning he was an enemy
rather than a friend.</p>

<p>The feeling passed, however, as soon as he
came into contact with him. Len was apparently
his usual genial self, with nothing more sinister
at the back of his mind than the preparations
for peas and potatoes. The rest of the men
arrived presently, and the gardens fell into their
usual routine. By the time the sun had broken
through, Kirkby was again beginning to wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
whether the letter and all that it stood for had
been anything more than a dream.</p>

<p>The very weather of yesterday, that soul-troubling
weather which had helped so largely
towards his decision, now seemed like a dream,
too. Looking at the fresh yet quiet colouring
of to-day, at outlines diamond-clear and yet
soft as human breath, he found it impossible
to re-imagine it. But that was the worst of
weather, as he knew, even although at the same
time it was the wonder of it. You were happy
on the good days, feeling that they would go
on for ever; but, on the other hand, the bad days
seemed as if they would go on for ever, too.
And the bad days were very dangerous, because
they were apt to make you lose heart. On the
bad days, if you were not careful what you were
doing, you might find yourself signing the whole
of your life away....</p>

<p>Yesterday had been a destructive day, so
bitter and killing that it seemed as if this morning
everything should have been withered; but
instead of being withered things were pulsing
with new vigour. Even where there was no
life showing above the soil, life spoke to him
from below. The air, vivifying yet soft, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
that baptismal touch which comes only at one
time of the year. And running all through
Nature was the thrill which comes out of nowhere,
like the Spirit, so that the quiet land
seemed to heave and thrill like sunlit waves of
sea.</p>

<p>It came to him now that, next year, when the
thrill was in the air, he would be in Canada.
It would be the same thrill, he told himself
hurriedly, because Nature’s magic was the same
everywhere; and yet it would not be quite the
same. On the soil where you had been born
and bred there was always something more.
Not only did you feel the thrill of the spring
that was coming, but the thrill of the springs
that were gone; so that, with each fresh spring
on your native ground, the thrill deepened
because of the past.</p>

<p><i>That</i> thrill, at least, if he went to Canada, he
would never feel again....</p>

<p>He had been right about Machell, he discovered
later.... He discovered it after breakfast,—a
breakfast which seemed to him more
like a meal in a railway station than anything
else. Beyond removing a few things from the
mantelpiece, and routing a few other things out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
of a cupboard, Mattie had not actually begun
her preparations for packing, but she managed
to give the impression, nevertheless. The ebb
and flow of her talk, rising and falling as she
passed between kitchen and larder, came to
him like the signals of approaching or departing
trains.... Finishing his meal more hurriedly
than usual, he went out to find Len again standing
staring at the cottage.</p>

<p>This time, however, Machell made no attempt
at concealment. Instead, he came forward to
meet his chief awkwardly but eagerly.</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, sir,” he began hastily,
as if unable to contain himself any longer,
“but there’s something I’d like to ask you.
It’s all over the place you’re giving up your
job, and I thought happen you’d put in a word
for me if I was to apply for it.”</p>

<p>For a moment or two after he had spoken
Kirkby did not know how to answer. He should
have been prepared for the shock, he knew, but
the fact remained that he was not prepared for
it. Absurd as it seemed, it had not yet occurred
to him that this sort of thing would follow
naturally upon his “notice.” It would have
come to him, of course, with the actual sending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of the letter, but so far he had not progressed
beyond the actual writing of it. His intuition
had been trying to warn him, it was true, but
he had not been able to grasp what it wished
to tell him. But it was clear enough to him
now why Len had seemed to him like a stranger
who might possibly do him harm....</p>

<p>“What makes you think I’m meaning to
give up?” he enquired at last, evading the
question, and shifting his gaze from the man’s
face to the greenhouse behind him.</p>

<p>Len wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Nay, I don’t know ...” he began, looking
down. “But it’s been all over the spot for
a long while now. They’ve got it down at the
village, too. Mrs. Kirkby’s always talked a deal
about leaving, you see,” he added, rather more
confidently, “and lately it’s seemed to me you
were leaning that way yourself.”</p>

<p>“How d’you mean—‘leaning’?” Kirkby
questioned him a second time, and Machell
wriggled again.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you haven’t been like yourself
for a bit now, if you’ll excuse my saying so.
Absent-minded and such-like, and not hearing
when folks spoke.... And, begging your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
pardon again, sir,” he finished, with a nervous
burst, “but you’re getting on. It’s only in
reason you should be thinking of retiring
before so long....”</p>

<p>He found himself presently on the further side
of the greenhouse, without quite knowing how
he had got there, or what he had said to Machell
before he went. He felt pretty sure, however,
that he must have promised him his support,
for he could still see the smile on the man’s
face, though distorted by panes of glass. But
he had got away quickly because he had not
felt equal to smiling at him in return. Indeed,
never in his life had he come so near to experiencing
the emotion of positive hate.</p>

<p>He understood now that he had never known
how much he had valued his position until he
was on the point of losing it. He had done well
at his job, of course, arriving early, and achieving
a horticultural reputation, not only in his own
immediate neighbourhood, but in a wider
district. Visitors to the Hall treated him with
deference, and consulted him as an authority.
He was invited to lecture, to judge at flower-shows,
to sit on the committees of various
societies. He had also written pamphlets,—one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
upon an Alpine plant which nobody else
in England had been able to grow, but which
grew quite simply and easily for Kirkby,
merely, as far as one could make out, because
he wished it to do so.</p>

<p>Successful, however, as he had been in his
own little world, he had never allowed it to
upset him. He had never been over-elated
about his doings, or tried to create an impression.
Indeed, he had hardly ever thought about
himself at all. He had taken the rewards of
life, when they came, as simply as he took the
fact of the pollen in the ripened flower.</p>

<p>But he had grown used to the situation, all
the same. He had grown to expect the deference
and the recognition, without knowing that he
expected them. They had ended by creating
a special atmosphere of his own in which he
moved and breathed as naturally as in the air
around him.</p>

<p>That atmosphere would be one of the things
which he would have to leave behind him when
he went to Canada. He would be nobody,—out
there. People might be kind to him, of
course, might even like him, but they would
know nothing about him. If they thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
him at all, it would probably be only as somebody’s
father, old-fashioned and rather a
nuisance. They would never know that he had
done anything or been anything,—out there.</p>

<p>He felt ashamed of himself at first for caring
so much about the loss of a thing like that, but
as he pondered the question further, he saw
deeper. It was not just conceit and vanity
that made people want recognition when they
were old. What they were looking for when
they asked for it was a definite confirmation
of their personality,—a vital necessity, without
which they were apt to wither away. They
were like cut flowers, he thought, once they had
lost their special identity. That was why so
many lingered on in the place where they had
lived and worked, feeling that they would die
if they were taken away from it. Even those
who had been neither pleasant nor useful in
their lives received some sort of recognition
in the place where they had lived. The new
folks whom you met when you were old often
seemed tacitly to deny that you had ever lived
at all. You fought against it, at first, but you
could do nothing about it. Presently, perhaps,
you even came to see yourself through their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
eyes as a sort of ghost,—a ghost who would
never have any future, and who had never had
any past....</p>

<p>And along with your life, of course, they
denied your work,—that work which was part
of you and yet was so much bigger than you,
and which you had fondly imagined would
still live on in people’s minds, even after you,
who mattered so much less than the work,
were dead and crumbled away....</p>

<p>One of the several garden-cats appeared at
that moment around a corner of the greenhouse,
and twined itself lovingly about his legs.
He could see another inside the greenhouse,
sitting on one of the stages, and still another
sunning itself happily inside one of the frames.
They were an old breed now, which had been
in the gardens for years—so old, indeed, that
he had ceased to distinguish between the
generations. For the same reason, and because
of their puzzling likeness to one another, they
had no individual names, but were known
collectively as The Cat.</p>

<p>They were an ugly breed, he supposed,
although he admitted it grudgingly,—brindled,
with the darker spots of the brindling appearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
invariably in the wrong places,—but he liked
to see them about. It gave him a sense of
pleasure to watch the sun bringing out on their
glossy sides the tawny hues which went so well
with wood and soil. He had grown so accustomed
to them, indeed, that a cat of any other
description about the place would have offended
his artistic eye.</p>

<p>The Cat was another of the things which he
would have to leave behind him when he went
to Canada,—the things which already he was
beginning to count over and to weigh before
the time came to let them go. He wondered
for a moment or two whether it would be
possible to take one of the breed with him,
but came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t do.
Mattie might not like it; the people at the other
end might not like it; and most certainly the
cat wouldn’t like it. No, it would never do.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together, after a while, and
went off about his business, but the beauty of
the young spring day was largely spoiled for
him. He even shrank from it, now, especially
when it called to him, attracting his attention
with scent and sigh in the fashion peculiar to
the spring. Instead of soothing and heartening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
him, as it had always done before, it now
seemed almost to attack him. He shrank from
The Cat, too, especially from the sight of the
sun touching it as it stalked across the gardens;
and, going into his little office to examine his
post which had just arrived, he shrank when he
found catalogues and circulars addressed to
“The Head Gardener.”</p>

<p>But most of all he found himself shrinking
when he had to approach any of his men,
fearing to find some other of them with Len’s
petition ready upon his lips. As it happened,
indeed, not one of them as much as hinted at
his going, let alone applied for his post; but
he continued to shrink from them, nevertheless.
Self-conscious with his staff for almost the only
time in his life, he felt that they talked about
him when they saw him coming, and talked
again when he went away.</p>

<p>He felt sure, at all events, that they knew what
was happening or about to happen, together
with the fact of Machell’s application. Discreet
as they might choose to be on their own
account, they must at least be aware of that.
He wondered how long the question of his
retirement had been discussed among them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
and how much time they had given him. It
humiliated him to think that the struggle
between himself and his wife should apparently
be common knowledge. Perhaps they had
even betted upon the contest, he said to himself,
bitterly, backing first one and then the other?
Or, perhaps, he added, with a cynicism which
was very foreign to him, they, too, had known
that he would be defeated from the start?...</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE impending change, he found, was
already at work upon the house when he
went in to his dinner. The whole place was
upset. Cupboards and doors stood open;
shelves had been stripped; while the contents
of the parlour looked as though they had been
having a waltzing competition. There was a
large packing-case in the coal-hole, and another
in the larder. Things which were usually
upstairs had somehow managed to get down,
while other things, which he had not seen for
years, were strewn about the kitchen. The very
atmosphere of the house seemed to have been
shaken and churned,—to have been stirred up as
violently as Mattie stirred her puddings. If he
had felt at breakfast as though they were already
at the station, he was now absolutely convinced
that they were actually on the steamer.</p>

<p>Only in one instance, however, did he make
any comment upon the upheaval. Mattie, as
far as he could see, had moved almost every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
piece of furniture in the house, merely, it would
appear, in order to prove that it was possible
to move it. He ventured to point out that some
time would have to elapse before they could
even hold their sale, and she answered him
rather curiously as they sat down to their meal.</p>

<p>“Nay, I know it looks rather silly to be moving
the stuff so soon, but I’d a reason for doing
it. We’ve got to settle what we’re going to take,
you’ll think on, and what we’re going to sell;
and I thought the sooner I started in at the job,
the better. But I found when I came to think
about it that I couldn’t <i>see</i> the things in any
spot but this! In fact, it wasn’t till I’d started
pushing and pulling ’em about that I could do
anything with ’em at all!”</p>

<p>“You do get used to seeing things in the same
spot,” Kirkby said, feeling at the sight of the
“pushed and pulled” objects surrounding him
much as he would have felt before a bed of
uprooted flowers.</p>

<p>“You do that!” Mattie agreed, passing a
hand over her heated face. “That used you
forget what they’re like altogether. Why, I
found I didn’t even know the shapes and sizes
of things when I came to look at them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“They get part of a place,—that’s what it is,”
Kirkby said. “You don’t see them as if they
were by themselves, but as if they were built
in.”</p>

<p>“Ours seemed built in right enough, this
morning, anyhow,—I know that! I never
remember them taking such a lot of managing
before. It was almost as if they knew what it
was all about, and didn’t mean to budge if
they could help it!”</p>

<p>It was warmer this morning, Kirkby said, and
likely she was feeling it a bit,—looking out as he
spoke at the thin, young, spring-glow lying
over the gardens, and wondering again how
yesterday could have been so different.</p>

<p>“Nay, it wasn’t that altogether, though I’m
not saying it mightn’t have something to do with
it....” Getting up, Mattie set an open tart,
light as an autumn leaf, on the table between
them. “But I can tell you I was real taken
aback when I found I didn’t even know my
own furniture! I made sure, for instance, as
that dresser of ours would be first-class for the
new house, but now that I’ve had a right good
look at it, I doubt it’s over-big. Then I thought
as how that corner-cupboard we bought would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
do nicely for our pots, but as soon as I got it
down I saw it was too small. It’s a queer thing,
it seems to me, when you’re so far out with your
own stuff! It’s like living with folks that long
you don’t even know their faces.”</p>

<p>“They get part of you,” Kirkby said once
more, as he had said about the house. “Faces
or furniture, it’s the same thing. They get
that much part of you, after a while, you don’t
rightly seem to notice them.”</p>

<p>Mattie looked about her at the disordered
fittings with a mixture of affection and distaste,
much as a mother might look at a host of unruly
children. “Ay, they do get part of you,” she
agreed reluctantly. “I never thought I should
mind parting with anything in this house.
I never liked the things, as you don’t need telling,
even though we bought ’em together; nay,
nor the house, neither. But I found, when it
came to it, that I wasn’t over-keen on letting
any of ’em go. It seemed sort of cruel, somehow,
to go leaving them behind.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not think twice about ’em,” he
assured her, “once they’re out of the road.
There’s no need to go fretting yourself over
a thing like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“I’m not fretting myself, not I,—nor likely
to be!...” She laughed across at him, her
lips curving and her eyes shining. She had
always been a woman of a fluid temperament,
easily up and down, but of late years it had
seemed to him that she had grown a little dry.
“Dry” seemed particularly the right word, he
thought, looking at her to-day, reminding him
as she did of a thirsty plant that was lifting its
head in the rain.</p>

<p>“I’d be likely to fret, wouldn’t I, on a day
like this?”... She leaned towards him,
laying her arms on the table, and emanating so
much sheer radiance of spirit that it almost
seemed as if there were an actual halo round her.
“Why, I’ve been rubbing my eyes half the
morning thinking it couldn’t be true! That was
why I was in such a hurry to get things sorted
out. It seemed as if it helped to bring it all
that much nearer.”</p>

<p>“It’s near enough, as it is,” he answered,
in perfectly good faith, and then looked up
guiltily, startled by something in his tone
which he had not intended to be there. But
she was too busy thinking to notice it.</p>

<p>“You’re right there! In fact, it beats me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
how we’ll ever be ready if we’re to get off, this
spring. Old folks like us can’t afford to be
kept waiting about.... It won’t be too soon
for them Over There, anyhow,—I know that!”
She laughed contentedly, looking past him over
his shoulder as if she saw welcoming hands
reaching towards her, and welcoming eyes
turned her way. “They’ll be sending word,
like enough, as we’re to go by flying-machine!”</p>

<p>“You’ve not got word written to them yet
we’re meaning to come?” Kirkby asked.
“We ought to let ’em know by the first mail.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve not got as far as putting pen to
paper, yet, if you mean that; but the letter’s
written all right! What, I had it off as pat as
you like before ever I’d had my breakfast!...
Come to that,” she added, “I’ve written that
letter many a time in my head during these last
ten years,—ay, and set it down as well, just to
liven myself with the sight of it!... In fact,
I’ve done it that often, it seems almost as if
there’d be no need to do it now.”</p>

<p>“If you go thinking about it like that, you’ll
likely never get it done at all,” he warned her,
but she only smiled.</p>

<p>“There’s no fear of that! I’ve never had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
bonnier job to do before, and I’ll likely never
have as good again!... Every spring when
it came round I’ve prayed as this might happen,
and it’s happened at last. It was always worse
in the spring. You can stand a deal of things
in the winter when you’re comfortable like,
and you’ve your own hearth-fire; but you
want to be stirring in the spring.”</p>

<p>He did his best to nod sympathisingly at the
wistfulness in her tone, but he could find no
answer to give her. He had never known what
it was to be afflicted by the fever of spring-wandering.
He had never wanted to leave his
gardens at any time, but especially not in the
spring. Leaving a garden before the spring-sowing
was finished would have seemed to him
like leaving a child before it was able to walk....</p>

<p>It was true, of course, that last night he had
signed his gardens away, and that, too, in the
spring. But he had only signed them away in
exchange for another garden, and the work
would be well on its way before he went. It
was not restlessness but weariness which had
forced him to a reaching-out towards new life;
not the spring-fret but the overwhelming pressure
of years which was driving him overseas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I just can’t believe we’re really going!”
he discovered Mattie to be saying, when his
mind returned to her. “It don’t seem possible.
To think we’re going to see the lads once more,
and hear ’em speak! They’ll have altered a
deal, I reckon, especially Joe. I always said
Joe would make something to look at, if he once
got going, and it’s queer if he hasn’t, out there.
They say the air’s that grand, it’s like fine wine.
I don’t know much about wine, but I’ve always
hankered after the sort of air that sounded like
it. I’ve sometimes thought I could breathe
a bit of it, after reading the letters.... Then
there’s the girls, too,—I fair ache to set eyes on
’em. Maggie, now,—she was always a good sort;
but I don’t know how I’ll contain myself when
I see Ellen. I thought a deal of ’em all, as you
know, and lads is always lads, but I’ve sometimes
thought I kept the softest spot of all for
my little Ellen!”</p>

<p>He heard the words at first as one hears a
familiar tune played from afar off, familiar but
unmeaning; but presently the intensity of her
feeling got home to him, and his outlook
brightened. He had been troubled when he
first came into the house, jarred both by its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
chaotic state and by the events of the morning,
but as the meal proceeded he found himself
calming gradually. It was impossible, in any
case, not to find something infectious in Mattie’s
attitude; to feel, if only as a pale reflection,
something of her ecstasy. With a deliberate
effort he adjusted his angle of mind, setting
aside his preoccupation with the things that he
must lose, and forcing himself to turn his
attention to the things that he would gain.</p>

<p>“They’ll be taken aback, Over There, when
they hear we’re coming!” he contributed
presently, more cheerfully. “I doubt they
won’t credit it, at first, we’ve been so long about
it!”</p>

<p>“Nay, they’ll credit it all right!” Mattie
laughed contentedly. “Many’s the time Maggie’s
told me she’s dreamt we were on the road.
All the same, they’ll be on pins till we’ve
actually arrived. They’ll be thinking every day
as we might go and change our minds.”</p>

<p>He shook his head without looking at her.</p>

<p>“Nay, we’ll not do that. It’s too big a thing,
is this, to go playing about with.”</p>

<p>“Too big a thing, and too short of time. It’s
got to be yes or no with folks when they get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to our time of life. Just yes or no....
Anyway, they’ll know it won’t be <i>me</i> as’ll be
likely to change,” she added, with a touch of
defiance. “It’s you they’ll be afraid of, if it’s
anybody.”</p>

<p>“They’ve no call to be afraid, nor you,
neither. I’ve passed my word, and I’m going
to keep it. I shouldn’t have written that letter
if I hadn’t meant it.”</p>

<p>“There’s many a letter gets written as is
never sent,” Mattie said, half-mischievously,
dallying, as human nature loves to do, on the
very threshold of happiness. “I was saying
something of the sort only just now.”</p>

<p>“This here’ll get sent right enough, don’t
you fear....” He straightened himself a
little, and his mouth set firmly. “Where’s it
got to, by the way? I’ll be making the round of
the place, this afternoon, and I could leave it
as I pass.”</p>

<p>She nodded a trifle vaguely in the direction of
one of the cupboards.</p>

<p>“I sided it away, so it wouldn’t get lost....
I could likely run down with it for you if you’re
busy?”</p>

<p>He said “no” to that, however, speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
with the same air of determination which sat
so strangely upon him. It might be Mattie
who, in the long run, had brought about the
present position, but dignity demanded that
at least he should hand in his own notice.</p>

<p>“I’d best see to it myself,” he told her,
getting up from the table. “Mind and give
it me before I go.”</p>

<p>“Likely I’d forget to give it you, isn’t it?”
she laughed; and then, still laughing, shivered....
“It fair gives me the creeps to think how,
if that letter never went, things’d be just the
same as before!”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t be quite the same, no matter
what happened. Folks pass on, somehow.
Even <i>trying</i> to do things makes a difference.”</p>

<p>“A deal o’ difference it’d make to me, I’m
sure,” Mattie answered him cynically, “if I
found myself still landed in this one-eyed
spot!... Ay, well, I won’t go fretting about
things, just when they’re shaping so nicely,”
she corrected herself quickly. “Anyway, I’m
glad you’ve seen your way to facing the job
at last.”</p>

<p>There was a hint of interrogation in her tone
as to how he had arrived at his decision,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
together with another and fainter one as to
how he was taking it. Standing, he looked away
from her through the window while he answered
her unspoken questions.</p>

<p>“It just came over me, as it were, that I
might never see the lads again if I didn’t do
something about it. You go on thinking
there’s time enough and to spare, and then all
of a sudden there comes a day when you think
there’s no time. That was how it was, yesterday.
I just sort of felt I’d be rare and glad to
see ’em all again.”</p>

<p>The tears came into Mattie’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You’ll never know <i>how</i> glad till you <i>do</i> see
’em!” she said, with a break in her voice.
“There’s nothing like your own flesh and blood,
when all’s said and done. And there’s the
grandchildren an’ all.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and the garden....” He turned to
her then, smiling a little shyly, a little shamefacedly.
“I’ve never let on to you about it,
Mattie, but I’ve been fair wild to see that
garden!”</p>

<p>She laughed back at him and his hesitation,
triumph and good-humoured affection mingled
on her countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“You’d no need to let on.... It was plain
enough, I’m sure! I’ve known for a long while
now you were thinking a deal about it.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, it’d be queer if you hadn’t, I suppose,—you’re
that sharp! But I’ve often
thought I’d like to take a look in and see how
the lads were framing.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be seeing how all right before you’re
a couple of months older!...” She got to
her feet, too, and began sweeping the pots
together in a series of joyous movements. “Eh,
but I hardly know how to hold myself in about
it! I was fair tongue-tied, last night, when you
said as we’d best go, but I’m that full of it all
to-day, I can’t keep it from wagging! What,
I’ve been clacking to the furniture all morning
for want of anything better,—telling it all about
it as if it was human beings! You’d have
laughed fit to crack if you’d seen the way I
went on. Len Machell popped in for a word
and catched me doing it, and he looked scared
out of his life!”</p>

<p>He stiffened a little at Machell’s name,
feeling a cold wind blow in upon him and his
manufactured enthusiasm. As before, the situation
had remained more or less in the air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
until Len touched it; but as soon as he laid
a finger upon it, it became concrete.... He
said “Machell?” after her, not as a question,
but as if weighing a sound which, in the space
of a morning, had grown sinister and threatening.
But she took no notice.</p>

<p>“I was making pretence this house was
Over There, and the furniture was the lasses
and lads. ‘Eh, Ellen, my girl,’ says I, hugging
the grandfather clock, ‘I’m that glad to see
you I could cry!’... ‘And is this little
Sally?’ I says, kissing yon little stool. ‘She’s
grown rarely since her last photo!’ Right
daft I must have looked, and no mistake, but
I couldn’t help it. I was that chock with it all
I had to get shot of it, one way or another.”</p>

<p>She was laughing and crying as she talked,
busy living over again the absurd scene which
had yet been so vivid and poignant, but for
once she did not receive the kindly smile with
which he usually rewarded her attempts at
humour. Instead, he turned away from her
again, almost as if he had been wounded and
wished to hide it.</p>

<p>“What was Len doing, hanging about the
place?” he enquired, surprising her both by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
his words and by his faintly-sharp tone, for
he was a lenient master with his men.</p>

<p>“Nay, what, he was only in the house half
a minute or so! You’ve no call to be vexed
with him, I’m sure. He just looked in to say
you’d told him we were leaving, and to ask
if there was anything he could do. He said
his missis would be glad to come up any time
to lend a hand with the packing, so I said the
sooner we set about it, the better.”</p>

<p>“I never told him we were going,” Kirkby
said, in the same almost angry tone, making
her stare again. “It was him as said it....
He said it was all over the spot, and had been
for long; and he wanted to know if it was true.”</p>

<p>She answered him soothingly as she carried
off the pots to be washed in the back kitchen.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, it doesn’t matter, does it, one way
or t’other? He’d have had to know, anyway,
before so long. I must say I was a bit surprised
to find you’d been so glib about it, but it makes
no odds. He didn’t tell <i>me</i> it was all over the
spot, but I might have guessed it. Folks always
seem to know what you’re meaning to do a
deal sooner than you do yourself!”</p>

<p>He picked up his hat from a side table, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
moved towards the door. The impulse was
strong in him to tell her of Machell’s application,
but he restrained it, being uncertain of
her attitude. He was longing for sympathy on
the subject, despising himself as he did for
the bitterness in his heart, and knowing that
sympathy would assuage it. But she had never
seemed to value his position as head gardener,—had,
indeed, constantly made him feel that it
was something to be ashamed of,—and he dared
not risk the reference. Yet he lingered before
going out, still playing about the question, as
if hoping that something or other might occur
to ease the trouble in his mind.</p>

<p>“I can’t say I’m best pleased to think Len’s
been settling our business for us,” he said, as
she came back into the kitchen. “He’s paid
to attend to his own job, and not to go prying
into ours.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t settled it for us,—not he! We’ve
settled it ourselves. And as for a bit of gossip
and such-like, I don’t see how you’re going to
keep folks from taking an interest in those
about them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t look for Machell and the rest of
the staff to go taking an interest in my private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
affairs.” He lifted his voice a little, and felt
a flame rise in him as she laughed. This was
the second time to-day that he had felt that
sudden spurt of hate, and in his horror at its
recurrence his bitterness deepened. He hastened
to get outside the door in case the hate
should suddenly decide to vent itself in angry
words.</p>

<p>Mattie followed him to the threshold.</p>

<p>“It’d be queer if the whole place didn’t
know I’d wanted to go!” she said briskly.
“There’s been times, I’m sure, when I’ve felt
like telling it all round England. It isn’t a
crime, anyway,—not as far as I know. We’d
a right to go if we liked. As for Machell, he’s
a decent-enough lad. I don’t see why you’re
so mad with him. Mrs. Machell’s a good little
soul, too, though she hasn’t much about her.
Let ’em talk if it pleases ’em! A deal o’ difference
it’ll make to us what they’re saying and
doing here, once you and me are a thousand
miles away!”</p>

<p>She stopped to draw breath both for fresh
laughter and fresh speech, and in the pause he
managed to break away from her. He went
slowly, it is true, still longing for the consolation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
which he had been denied, and bowed by her
last words as though she had set a weight upon
him. The thousand miles of which she had
spoken were laid like lead about his neck.
But he went, all the same.... By the time she
was speaking again he had rounded the corner
of the greenhouse and was lost to her. He heard
her voice continuing for a moment, as if not
even the consciousness of his departure could
force it into silence, and then break as if something
had snapped it. He walked on blindly,
not heeding where he was going.</p>

<p>And neither of them had remembered the
letter.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HE had intended to set off on his round as
soon as he had finished his dinner, but
in the end it was half-past two and after before
he finally started out. Something seemed to
detain him, whispering in his ear that this was
the last time, and he could not bear that it
should be the last time. It was not true, of
course, since he would be certain to make the
round of the gardens many times yet before
he left, but he felt as if it was true. It <i>was</i> true,
in point of fact, in so far as it was the last round
of his period of settled service. In any case,
he shrank and lingered a little before setting
out, as a man shrinks and lingers a little before
starting upon a world-circling journey from
which he may never return.</p>

<p>Yet all the time he was longing to be gone,
and to be able to ease the strain upon his nerves
by fresh scenes and steady movement. He was
still nervous of the men; the kitchen garden
still irked him; the sight of The Cat stealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
softly across the soil still foolishly made him
ache. But it was not until the gilded freshness
of the short spring day began to dim a little
that he roused himself to action, hurrying now
where he had loitered and fretted, as if in a
sudden panic lest he should be too late.</p>

<p>Passing the last of the greenhouses, he crossed
between borders of box to an arch in the high
wall, where there were cherry-trees nailed flat
to left and right like the sticks of so many fans.
There was a little wicket-gate beneath the arch,
and as he laid his hand upon it he turned. Even
from that distance he could discern the figure
of Machell in one of the houses, and by the
stillness of his attitude he could tell that he
was watching him. Watching to see the last of
him, he said to himself, bitterly!... Watching
as he would watch him on that last day,
when he saw him leave the home of his youth
for ever.</p>

<p>Even when he had passed along to the right,
so that the wall came between him and Len,
he could still feel his eyes fixed upon him,
following him. They troubled him, making
him nervous and uncertain in his movements,
conscious that his back was bent and his step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
not altogether steady. He became so obsessed
by them, at last, that suddenly he swung round,
certain that Len had followed him across the
garden, and was watching from the gate. There
was no one under the arch, however, and he
moved on again, feeling hot and foolish; yet
nevertheless the intolerable sensation of being
spied upon remained.</p>

<p>Down the steep rush of the hill he went beneath
tall, splendidly-spaced trees, the smooth
grass between which would presently be
coloured and starred by daffodils and wild
white hyacinths. Under the leafless boughs
of beech he could see the hills,—the mountain-land
and moorland which ring in all this
part of the country, except where, on the one
side, it runs rolling to the sea. In the natural
arches to his right were framed the long slopes
of the park, and almost beneath his feet as he
came down were the massed roofs of the Hall.</p>

<p>He had never thought very much about the
Hall before, even though the greater part of his
life had been spent in its vicinity. He had
accepted it, of course, as the central fact of the
situation, the reason for which he and his work
existed at all; but he had not thought much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
about it. The gardens were his world, especially
the kitchen garden, and once outside their
limits things were apt to seem a little blurred.
There were many days when the Hall, empty
and still, and wrapped in rain or mist, seemed
almost as far away from him as his lads in
Canada.</p>

<p>But to-day he looked at it as he came down,
trying to see it, to take it in, so that, once safely
photographed on his memory, it should never
afterwards escape him. And at once he found,
as Mattie had found with the furniture, that he
could not see it. Instantly association was
upon him, refusing to allow his mind to focus
on shape or size. He could not decide whether
the house were beautiful or ugly, dignified or
insignificant, of this period or that. As he had
said to Mattie of her household gear, it was no
more possible to judge it than it was to judge
a familiar face.</p>

<p>He had, it is true, an impression of fine stone,
of moulded windows and doors, a wide courtyard,
pillars, steps, and soft-coloured, slated
roofs. But always he found it impossible to
see it as it would have looked unclad and without
its background. Always his eye went to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
creepers which he had tended upon it, to the
shelter of the woods behind it, the run of
the park before it, to the long lawns and the
gravel sweep and the curving boundary of the
river. And even those he could not see as
another person would have seen them, for he
had looked at them so long that it was only
the spirit he saw, and never the bodily forms
which contained and expressed that spirit....</p>

<p>Yet this place, grown so impalpable to him
that he could not even focus it, had him closely
welded to it. He knew vaguely that you could
not separate him from it without hurting him,
any more than you could strip the creepers
from the walls without leaving a scar. House
and land had grown impalpable to him because
between him and them moved the pictures of
his past, so that you could not sever him from
them without damaging him, because what you
would really be separating him from was his
own life.</p>

<p>There was a centralising power about the
mansion of a big estate of which those who had
never been connected with one could have no
knowledge. It was like a huge buoy to which
you were attached,—so safely attached that, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
matter what came or went on the ocean outside,
you, at least, could never slip away. Those
outside must often feel a little lost, he had
sometimes thought, shrinking from that possible
isolation even in his mind. But, anchored
to a place like the Hall, you had no fear of getting
lost. Although you could not see it because
you knew it so well, it was at all events a background
against which you could see yourself,—as
small, indeed, and comparatively unimportant,
but still more or less plainly. Once
broken away from that background, however,
and out in the open,—in Canada, for instance,—it
seemed highly probable that you would not
be able to see yourself at all.</p>

<p>He spoke to one or two of his men who were
busy about the grounds, rolling the gravel or
trimming the turf, but always with the same
anxiety and suspicion which had afflicted him
all the morning. They were not Machell, it
was true, but each one of them seemed to him
to represent Machell, and, when he left them,
he felt that they followed him with Machell’s
searching eyes.... It seemed an incredible
thing that he, who had always taken his fellow-beings
so simply and so kindly, should now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
be unable to meet them with an open mind.
It made him ashamed and angry, so that his
glance refused to meet theirs, and his voice
sharpened when he spoke to them, as it had
done with Mattie during the scene in the cottage.
Even the Hall servants he would have
regarded doubtfully if he had chanced to come
across them, feeling sure that they, too, knew
what was about to happen to him, and would
spring their knowledge upon him before he was
ready to meet it.</p>

<p>But he saw nobody as he passed in front of
the house, walking with what he felt to be a
furtive step which he was yet unable to alter,
and pausing only to inspect the rose-bushes
fronting the long line of the low terrace.
Nobody opened the door and came to him,
or hailed him from the stone verandah. He
glanced nervously at the windows over his
shoulder, but nobody looked out. The whole
place, indeed, had a strangely hushed appearance,
almost as if it had veiled its eyes while
this its servant went on his last round.</p>

<p>Hurrying in the same almost slinking fashion
along the central walk, he came to the cliff-side,
and stood looking across the beautiful, dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
stream to the mountain-wall beyond. He could
scarcely remember a time when, passing through
the grounds, he had not paused just there, with
the great trees around and above him, and the
rocky river below. The wide view, passing
over the wooded cliff across, and rising by
green and russet slopes to that last long line
of loveliness above, sometimes many-coloured
and strong, and sometimes faint and phantasmal
as a cloud, had been all that he had ever
wanted by way of “escape.” It seemed impossible
now that, yesterday, when he had
needed it so much, he should never even have
thought of it. One look at the open fells, at
the swift river running black between its
carved banks, at the endless crossing and re-crossing
of fine bough-traceries against the
colourless sky, and his sudden revolt against
his environment would have been as suddenly
stilled. Just that one look, and things would
have found their proper balance again; one
look, and he would never have dreamed of
writing the letter....</p>

He swung round on his heel when he remembered
the letter, and stood staring towards
the Hall as if through its solid structure he<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>
could see Mattie waving to him from the hill
beyond. Mattie would think that he had
forgotten the letter on purpose, and he did not
want her to think that. He could hardly believe
that, having spoken of it just as he was on the
point of leaving the house, he could yet have
managed to come away without it. He even
searched his pockets, as if feeling that, by
sheer determination, he could persuade it to
materialise; stared at his hands, as if thinking
that they might contain it without his knowledge.
But it was obvious that he had not got it, and
with a curious inconsistency he felt furious
and frustrated. He said to himself that he
wanted the matter over and done with,—that
he could not bear to have it hanging on like
this. He even retraced his steps for a short
distance, as if meaning to climb the hill again
in order to fetch the letter. If he had discovered
it in his possession at that particular
moment, he would have thrust it in at the Hall
not only with relief but with actual triumph.

<p>But almost at once he turned again as though
somebody had tugged at his jacket. He was
tired, this afternoon, and knew that he would
regret the extra effort before he was half-way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
up the hill. Time was getting on, too, and if
he lingered much longer it would be dusk
before he was back from across the river. And
Machell could take the letter.... He smiled
a wry little smile as he reflected with what keen
delight Machell would take the letter!...</p>

<p>He cast another glance at his view as he came
back, remembering how often he had tried to
persuade Mattie to find in it the release which
he found in it himself, and how dismally he
had failed. Mattie had had no use for it either
as a view or as an outlet. She had liked the space
and the height, but she had disliked the hills.
For her they had merely been other and greater
walls, which she could not push away. And
she had hated the river.... Besides, nearly the
whole of the view was to the north and east,
and Mattie had spent the greater part of her
life with her heart turned towards the west....</p>

<p>Also she had not cared much for being seen
about the Hall grounds, even at those times when
the owners happened to be away. It was only
with difficulty that he had induced her to attend
any of the Hall functions,—the cottage-garden
show, the tenants’ garden-party, or the servants’
ball,—and then she had only appeared under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
protest. His employers had sensed the protest,
he felt sure. In as close and delicately-dovetailed
a corporation as that of an estate, it was
always easy to detect the person who deliberately
stood outside.</p>

<p>Nor had she ever attempted to make intimate
friends of any of the people in the district.
They would have accepted her all right, for
she was both amusing and clever, as well as
a hard worker. But right from the first she had
either rejected her neighbours’ overtures, or
accepted them against her will, and gradually
they had come to acknowledge the situation,
and to realise that they could get no further.</p>

<p>He had spoken to her quite early upon the
subject, seeing where she was drifting, but he
had not succeeded in changing her mind.</p>

<p>“What’s to do you won’t take tea with Mrs.
Grisedale?” he had enquired one afternoon,
as he came in. “I met her just now when I was
down at station after some weed-killer as hasn’t
turned up, and she was right grieved about it.
They’re having a few friends in, she says, for
that christening-party of theirs, and she’s keen
for you to be there.”</p>

<p>“I just didn’t fancy it, that’s all,” Mattie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
had said, although taking care not to meet his
eye. “It’s a bit of a trial, I always think,
talking to folks as you don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s easy mended, isn’t it, and the
sooner you start in at it the better? Mrs.
Grisedale, for one, ’ll not take you long. She
seems a decent little soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ay, she’ll do.”</p>

<p>“There’s Mrs. Ellwood an’ all,—she’s asked
you time and again. She told me she’d never
taken to anybody as she’s taken to you.”</p>

<p>“And she’ll do, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what’s to do you can’t make
friends with the pair of them?” Kirkby had
blundered on. “You couldn’t have a nicer
couple of folks than them two, and you’ll be
wanting somebody.”</p>

<p>But he had had to probe for some time
before she would give him the explanation.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” she had said at last, half-ashamed,
as he could see, and yet determined
upon her line of action. “It just isn’t worth
while. Making friends takes a deal of time and
a deal of patience, and once you’ve got ’em
made, it takes a deal of getting over if you’ve
got to leave them. Well, it isn’t worth it. I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
set on getting away from this spot, as you don’t
need telling, and if I take up with any of the
folk, it’ll all be wasted.”</p>

<p>“Nay, what, friendship and such-like is never
wasted, surely!” he had affirmed stoutly.
“I don’t hold with gardeners getting too thick
with folks, nor their wives, neither. There’s
some as’ll seek you out just for the sake of
what’s behind you. But it isn’t good, all the
same, to be always by yourself, and a few nice
friends’d likely help you to settle down.”</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for his cause, he had hit
on the one plea that was least likely to weigh
with her.</p>

<p>“Nay, but that’s just what I don’t want to
do,” she had said, looking past him, with the
effect, which he was later to know so well, of
seeing beyond him into great distances. “I
don’t know how to put it, but it would be wrong
for me, would that. It’d be losing something
as is right down necessary to me. If making
friends with folks is going to mean settling
down, then I’m best without it.”</p>

<p>That part of the explanation he had been quite
unable to understand, so he had concentrated
upon the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“I don’t see there’ll be that much wasted
just by you going to Mrs. Grisedale’s christening-party!”
he had said humorously. “It
seems a real pity you shouldn’t have a pill-gill
now and then. I’ve always thought you
were just cut out for going amongst folks and
keeping ’em all lively.”</p>

<p>At all events he had succeeded in making her
laugh at that, changing her, to his relief, from
the far-gazing woman who chilled him with
her strangeness to the brisk, cheerful girl whom
he had sought in marriage.</p>

<p>“Ay, I generally manage to make a stir,
wherever I am!” she had said gaily. “I’m
not one for sitting mum in corners, and never
was. If I’d had luck to hit on a spot I liked,
I’d have done as much as anybody to keep
things going; but it’s no use thinking about
it here.”</p>

<p>And she had never swerved from her determination
during the years which followed,—never
swerved at heart, that is, for she had not
been hard and fast about it. She had got to
know both Mrs. Grisedale and Mrs. Ellwood
in the end, as well as the usual run of people
in the district. She had gone to parties in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
time. She was never behindhand, either,
when help of any sort was required, for she was
a kind enough woman, in spite of her discontent.
But she had never got to the point
of making intimate friends. Always she had
looked beyond her neighbours to that distant
thing in which they had neither lot nor part.</p>

<p>Descending the steep steps which led to
the water’s edge, he came to the catamaran
moored in its pool between the wooded sides
of the worn gorge. Going aboard, he began to
wind himself from bank to bank, the light,
wooden raft moving easily on its steel pulleys.
The water was quiet enough here, black and
almost still, but on either hand he could see
the fretted rush of one of the fastest streams in
England. A beautiful river, winding and sweeping
and leaping.... A river which could rise
in a few hours and become a broad, flying
torrent, with crisp, curling waves like those
of the neighbouring sea.</p>

<p>And at once, almost the very moment, it
seemed, that he pushed off, the ache at his heart
left him, succumbing to that curious influence
which water has upon the human mind. The
detachment it breeds worked upon him even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
in that black pool which could for no more than
a moment give pause to the sea-going mountain
stream. The smooth rush out across the unrippled
surface was a steady rush into peace.
His nerves eased in the gliding movement of
the raft, held to earth though it was by that
velvet pull on its under side. He drew deep
breaths as he worked at the creaking handle.
His released mind took to itself wings.</p>

<p>For he had been a boy on this river, and
nothing that life had so far attempted to give
him had ever equalled that. He had been
a boy, climbing among its rocks, swimming in
its pools, watching its hidden life and learning
its hidden lore. He had known it empty almost
as a sand-channel is empty when the water
alters its course; seen it foaming and full,
a swirling engine of destruction. It had been
the playground of his youth, and at the same
time it had been his friend, for to his young mind
it had had all the personality and importance
of a dominant human being.</p>

<p>He was a boy again now, as he grounded the
raft softly, and softly stepped off on the other
side, as if stepping into a church. Here, where
he had spent so many hours with other lads, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
alone, there lingered for him still the holy
touch of youth. It was in the water and in the
air, in the colour and shape of things, and in
the peculiar values of the light. Above all, it
was in that atmosphere of childhood which
never changes, and which is so distinct from
any other that it can be recognised even in
the dark.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment or two after he had
landed, surrendering himself joyfully to the
ancient thrill, and seeking from point to point
for reminders which should serve to accentuate
it. Here, where a low bough, along which he
had often walked, still thrust out its bold and
crooked arm over the racing water.... There,
where the salmon rose in the summer ...
where the bathing-strand lay firm and dry ...
where the long curve of the rose-gardens
against the river even at this time of the year
showed a velvet line. It seemed to him as he
stood, quivering to the thrill, that never until
now had he grasped the meaning of its peculiar
comfort. Its virtue lay in that easy leap back
to childhood, which made of life such a little
thing, and at the same time held such a vivid
assurance of a life that should be eternal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>But you could never hope to receive that
comfort except in the home of your youth.
No other place would do; not Canada, nor
another.... In any other place you would
have to grow old patiently without that blessed
assurance, and to bolster up your faith in a
future existence as best you might.</p>

<p>He had planned to get face to face with the
Canadian problem as soon as he was safely
across the river, out of reach of the staring
eyes of his staff and of Mattie’s exultation.
He had meant to set forth to himself the
advantages of the change, to conjure up the
presence of his children and to dwell happily
upon the interest of their garden. He had
meant to meet, once for all, the call of the things
he would have to leave, so that, no matter what
else might lie before him, he could never
suffer as much again. He had intended to
return from his round already passed over in
spirit to the new life in the new country, having
said good-bye once and for all to the life he had
lived in the old.</p>

<p>But he found that he could not think of either
his lasses or his lads as he climbed the shallow
steps which guided him up the rock-garden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
strive as he might to picture them in their far
homes under that high sky of which Mattie
had spoken so often and so fondly. They were
not real to him on this ground where, the instant
he set foot on it, he relinquished his own
manhood. Always they slipped away from
him as ghosts might slip away. He had,
indeed, one rather frightening moment when
he found that he could not even remember
their names.</p>

<p>He wandered for a long time in his country
of the past, including both past and present in
his gesture of farewell. At point after point
along the paths he stopped to dream and stare,
seeing the long, plant-carpeted terraces which
he had planned, and could not have told whether
they were the old or the new things that he
saw. But in any case it did not matter. The
old and the new were fused for the time being
to make a greater loveliness, a finer air; that
special atmosphere in which he lived again his
own enchanted youth, and was permeated, as
he looked, by the happiness which is a foretaste
of the happiness of eternity.</p>

<p>Some inward monitor brought him back
again at last to the raft, set his fingers to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
stiff handle, and pushed him off across the quiet
water. The mist was high above the river by
now, so that, as he passed into it, he was lost
to sight from either bank, with only the melancholy
creaking of the machinery to locate his
whereabouts. But he did not feel lost, because
of the coloured picture of youth which still
glowed and moved upon the vaporous canvas
before him. He was still at peace, still sure both
of this world and the next, when he met the
further bank with a sudden shock.</p>

<p>There came back to him with the shock the
realisation not only of his physical but of his
mental position. Climbing up the wood-edged
steps, he rose both out of the mist and
out of the boyhood dream which had so contentedly
ensnared him. He looked back for
a moment before turning resolutely towards
the Hall, and saw the mist lying like a shroud,
not only upon the river, but upon the precious
things of his own past.</p>

<p>He had lingered and dallied during the last
hours as if time had suddenly ceased to be, so
that he was forced to hurry now in order to
make up for it. All day, he thought, he had
been behaving like that, alternately dawdling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and hurrying, and then forgetting and dawdling
again.... The men had disappeared who
had been working in the grounds, and were no
doubt up at the kitchen garden, waiting for
him. It was pay-day, too, he remembered
suddenly, with quick dismay, and they would
not be best pleased at being kept waiting for
their money. They would say it was time he
went, he told himself, as he skirted the still-silent
house, and came again to the steep path
which mounted his own hill. They would
echo the words which Machell had all but
spoken, that morning,—that it was patent to
all and sundry that he was getting too old for
his job.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty now in thinking of his
children over the sea, less than no difficulty in
remembering their names. The whole Canadian
project came back to him, with all that it entailed,
together with the memory of yesterday’s
fatal promise. He could no longer hide from
himself that, for him, at least, that promise
had been fatal, whatever it might mean for
Mattie. It was a knife set at his own throat,
a pair of shears at his own roots. Even if he
had not known the truth before he started on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
his round, he could not have helped but know
it after those hours across the river.</p>

<p>The men were waiting for him, as he expected,
and he paid them hurriedly, taking care not to
look at them, and without any of the little
kindly enquiries and comments which he often
had for them. He had hoped that Machell,
being the first paid, would be the first to go,
but instead he lingered behind the others.
Coming out of his office, he found him waiting
for him outside, looking rather unhappy.</p>

<p>“If you could spare me a minute, sir ...”
he began, looking more abashed than ever by
Kirkby’s movement of recoil. “I just wanted
to say I hope I didn’t put you about by what
I mentioned to you this morning.”</p>

<p>“Why should it put me about?” Kirkby
asked, looking, not at him, but at The Cat,
which, moving tawnily between the white
purity of the evening light and the warm brown
of the soil, had developed an unearthly beauty
of its own.</p>

<p>“No reason at all, I’m sure, if you’re really
meaning going. But it struck me afterwards,
thinking about it, that perhaps I’d been over-smart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“You’ve got to put in early, these days, if
there’s a job going begging,” Kirkby said,
wishing so earnestly that the man would go
that he felt as if he were pushing him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know. And there’s others to
think of, too.... But I should be sorry if
I’d put you about. It’s seemed to me all day
as you were a bit down——”</p>

<p>But to be told that he looked “down” was
more than Kirkby could bear,—more than he
could bear to know that he carried the mark
of his defeat.... Waving both Machell and
his consolation away, he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>“You’ve no call to worry yourself, my lad,”
he found himself saying, both his sense of
justice and his native politeness forcing him to
the speech. “You get off home. If I do
send in my notice, you’ll be more than welcome
to the job.”</p>

<p>He heard Machell begin to speak again as he
walked away,—broken but grateful phrases,
ending bravely with: “If you’re stopping
on, there’ll be nobody better pleased than me
...” followed presently by the sound of the
man’s footsteps receding along the path. He
turned then, and watched him walk across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
gardens, noticing, as he thought, the already-possessive
glance which he cast on either hand.
At the gate Len stopped and looked back towards
the elder man, and even at that distance their
glances seemed to meet and mingle as over some
prone and coveted body. When finally he had
closed the gate and disappeared, there came
from Kirkby’s lips a little sound that was like a
cry....</p>

<p>It occurred to him presently that Mattie would
be waiting for him, as other people had already
waited, that day, and he turned mechanically
towards the house. He shrank, however,
as he remembered the state of the place as he
had found it, earlier on, as well as from the fresh
transports which Mattie would have in store
for him. He felt, as he had felt about Machell’s
rough attempts at sympathy, that he could not
bear them just now.... Swerving away to
the right before he reached his home, he took
a path which led him beyond the walls into the
healing quiet of empty spaces.</p>

<p>The spring evening was very still, so still
that, as he stood, he could hear the faint cry
of new-born lambs from across the river. All
over the land was that cool silver light which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
so much more mystic, and at the same time more
intimate, than any other. An incredible gentleness
had come upon the earth under its touch.
Bathed in that heavenly light it became suddenly
more human. Beneath it, the brown
plough lay warm and rich, while the grassland
looked springy and deep, a comfort to eye and
foot. The woods to the west showed silver
palings between their trunks, while down on
the flat the plantations looked like clumps of
sepia feathers. In the soft yet clear air everything
seemed to draw together, the white-faced
farm-houses, the woods, the hills, the gentle,
coloured earth ... gathered to hear the happy
message with which the whole world seemed to
thrill.</p>

<p>High on a bough above him a blackbird
began to sing, and again there came from Kirkby’s
lips that sound that was like a cry....</p>

<p>In the drawn dusk he wandered about the
gardens, seeing the glass-houses, which were
so brisk and coloured in the day, ghostly as
water is ghostly under the first finger of the
dark. Mattie had made no attempt to look for
him, so that he was alone, as he had been in the
early hours, but without the solace of his vision.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
The procession of the year no longer marched
in strength before him, sounding its coloured
trumpets as it passed. When he came to the
place where the dawnbell was to stand, he could
no longer picture it blue and exquisite against
the soil.</p>

<p>For the third time that day rage seized him as
he stood looking down at the dark ground which
had blossomed so easily for him in the morning,
but from which he could now conjure nothing
but despair and gloom. He knew definitely
now that he had been trapped by fate, and felt
none the less bitter because he had sprung the
trap with his own hand. He thought of his
children with love, but knew that for such as
himself there were things which were more
than children. Closer to him than breathing,
and nearer than hands and feet.... His
children had grown away from him and made
a life for themselves; but he, if he was to
follow them, could do nothing but pine and die.</p>

<p>He made up his mind as he stood that he
would go back on his word, and that after to-day
he would shut his ears to Mattie’s pleadings
for ever. If she must go, she must go alone,
and he must manage as best he might. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
letter had not been delivered yet, as far as he
knew, and, even if it had, he could always
withdraw his notice. They would not be hard
on him at the Hall, knowing well enough as they
did what had brought him to this pass. For in
writing that letter he had been trapped ...
trapped! The rage in him was so great that
he shook with it as he stood, clenching and unclenching
his hands and grinding his teeth.
This time he actually cried aloud, and it seemed
to him that the cry rushed out and over the
walls, so that even down at the Hall they could
hear him shouting that he was trapped....</p>

<p>And then suddenly Mattie’s face came to
him as he had seen it, that morning, fresh and
sweet and glad after her dream-tryst of the
night. He saw the light in her eyes, and heard
the break in her voice. He thought of her
years of beating against the bars, and of how
for her the trap he had sprung for himself
meant the opening of her prison-gate. Remembering
these things, he knew that he could
not break his promise.... Slowly his rage
subsided and his hands unclenched. He stood,
an indistinct figure in the dusk, with drooped
shoulders and bowed head. He had promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Mattie, and he could not fail her. Perhaps,
once safely Over There, he might be allowed
to find peace, and forget.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Turning towards the house, he saw Mattie
running and stumbling towards him across the
gardens.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MATTIE never forgot what she had felt
when she awoke on that miracle-morning,—never
forgot, and never allowed
herself to remember.... She came back to
consciousness still swathed and steeped in the
sweetness of her dream, arriving presently,
with a little shock of joy, at the thought of the
sweeter fulfilment which was to follow. At the
moment, however, she found it difficult to
believe that the latter could possibly be more
concrete than the former. So real, so intense
had been that experience of the spirit, that the
senses also seemed to have been satisfied by it
for the time being.</p>

<p>She lay on for some time after she had told
Kirkby of the beautiful journey which she had
taken in the night, living it over again to fresh
thrills of delight which were like little inward
cries of pleasure. (<i>So</i> they had looked and
spoken, and held, and kissed....) It was
not often, except in the case of illness, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
had allowed herself the luxury of staying in bed.
Very occasionally she had yielded to it when
life was pressing too hardly upon her, watching
the hours drift by with a hopelessness which
was in itself a sort of hope, knowing as she did
that, when that phase was over, she would be
able to take up existence again a little more
cheerfully. But she had never yet stayed in
bed because the moments in front of her were
so rich and wonderful that she could afford to
waste them.... A sort of radiance seemed to
her to pervade the room, in which the earthly
day had not yet quite prevailed, so that she felt
that, if anybody should look in upon her, just
then, they would see her through a wall of light.</p>

<p>She had said to Kirkby that she was “back,”—back
in her prison, she had meant,—speaking
the word with a bitterness which had first
driven him out, and then almost brought him
back to comfort her; but he was barely out of
the room before she was gone Canada-wards
again. She had forgotten so much about Them,
she said to herself, half-ashamed to have forgotten,
and wholly enchanted by the reminder.
She had forgotten Luke’s habit of cocking his
head on one side as he talked, and Joe’s love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
of humming a tuneless tune, while he drummed
out the beat of it on his knee. Maggie’s shrug
of the shoulders, and Ellen’s trick of half-closing
her eyes when she laughed, together
with that little way she had of touching you
affectionately when she sat beside you....
Joe’s eldest boy hummed, too, and Ellen’s
baby shut its eyes in the same fascinating
fashion. It put out its hands to you in the
same way,—little, round, baby hands groping
half-consciously for the comfort of human
touch.</p>

<p>It was astonishing, she thought, that people
who cared for their children should forget so
much about them. Not, of course, that you
forgot <i>them</i>. You had only to think of them,—sometimes
it happened without your thinking,—and
their faces came up before you, in a sort
of halo of light. But the little tricks and ways
which held so much of their character seemed
to fade if you were parted from them for years.
Perhaps it was as well that they should fade,
seeing how much they could hurt you to
remember.</p>

<p>It had not occurred to her that she might
be going to dream about the children when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
went upstairs to bed. Indeed, to be perfectly
frank, she had hardly thought about them at
all. A great exhaustion had fallen upon her
as soon as she realised that her forty years’
struggle against circumstances was over. It
had been hard to realise it, too. Even while
Kirkby was writing the letter, she had found
it difficult to believe that he was really doing
it. Each moment, also, she had expected that
he would break off and refuse to finish, and had
found it incredible that he should continue
calmly to the end. Indeed, he had puzzled her,
last night, as much as she had puzzled him.
To her, too, as to him, it had seemed impossible
that the mere writing of a letter could bring
so much to a close.</p>

<p>Even when it lay before her, addressed and
sealed, and Kirkby, without any sign of repentance,
had let it lie, she had felt no sensation
either of joy or triumph. Instead, she had felt
that great weariness, as after a heavy burden
at last laid down, together with a curious impression
of being out in a great space, without
any sense of direction. She had seen herself,
during those few moments in which she groped
aimlessly about the kitchen, as a coloured balloon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
broken suddenly from its tether, and
drifting out across the world at the light mercy
of the winds.</p>

<p>Nor, when she was alone upstairs, had she
felt any glow of happiness over her victory.
She had not cried, as Kirkby, sitting and waiting
below, had imagined her to be crying. She had
simply undressed as rapidly as possible, still
feeling that curious unsteadiness as she moved
about the room; and, once in bed, had seemed
to pass instantly to that far-off place which
was still more real to her perceptions than
anything that she saw around her.</p>

<p>She had not visualised herself as going, nor
could she remember anything about her actual
arrival. She had merely found herself There,
already a settled member of the little community.
But she had known well enough when the time
came for coming away; perhaps because,
after all those years of longing, it was easier
to get There than to leave.</p>

<p>She had seen herself passing between the
houses, moving from one to the other with
the assurance of long custom, and never once
feeling that anything was strange. She had
known which paths to take, which windows to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
look through, which rooms to enter. She had
known that you always had trouble with
Maggie’s doors, and that Ellen’s water-supply
wasn’t as good as it might be. She had known
that Luke had a piano, and that Joe (who
hadn’t risen to one yet, in spite of his fondness
for humming), sent his children to Luke’s to
practise. She had known the hours they kept,
the clothes they wore, their furniture and their
meals, their neighbours and their hired men.
And they had known that she knew. She had
fitted into their midst as a glove fits a hand
which has never taken it off.</p>

<p>And other things, too,—the sort which nobody
told, and which couldn’t by any chance have
got into their letters. Just when Maggie’s
husband was a bit tiresome with Maggie, and
where Joe’s missis failed in being just what he
had hoped she would be.... Those queer
sisters-in-law of Ellen’s; and Luke’s father-in-law,
who was the sort you could quite well
do without.... The trouble about the bit of
money which Joe had lent Maggie’s husband....
The trouble about the bit of money
which Ellen had lent Joe....</p>

<p>It surprised her to remember how much at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
home she had felt, how completely in tune with
conditions which she had never experienced
in the flesh. Why, she had even felt at home
in the house which she had seen as already
built for herself and Kirkby, although in point
of fact it was not yet in existence! Just by
closing her eyes she could see herself in, it
again, could feel, as she had felt in the night,
her pleasure in her environment. It was a small
house, of course, with no more than four rooms
in it, at the most, but it was a smallness which
made for comfort and not constriction. She
had felt so happy in it, so snug, that she laughed
contentedly at the very remembrance. It was
a queer thing, when you came to think of it,
and rather uncanny, that you could feel at
home in a house which hadn’t even been built!</p>

<p>There were more than four rooms in the
cottage in which she had lived so long, but she
had always felt pressed in upon by it, and as if
she could hardly breathe. It was a good place,
of course, and a big one, as cottages went,—almost
too big, indeed, when it came to single-handed
work. But she had never yet felt at
home in it, or known the intimate joy of the
home-lover and the home-maker. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
done her duty by it, that was all. She had
lived and worked in it merely as a caretaker
might have lived and worked, and on the few
occasions when she had gone away from it she
had felt as if it had ceased to exist....</p>

<p>There was only one thing which had troubled
her in the dream, and she had not said anything
to Kirkby about it. Indeed, she had almost
forgotten it when she awoke, safe in her hopes
as she was, as if ringed by shields; but now
it set her mind wondering and her brow
wrinkling.... She had been troubled and
puzzled because of the questions which They
had asked her.</p>

<p>Maggie, for instance, had wanted to know all
about the people at home,—who lived in this
place and that, and a lot of other things which
she had been put to it to answer.</p>

<p>“Who’s got Beck Edge, nowadays, Mother,
and Field Howe? Beck Edge belonged to the
father, didn’t it, and t’other to the son? I
remember hearing they wanted to change about,
but I don’t know if they ever did.”</p>

<p>Her mother, however, had been quite unable
to clear up the mystery,—if mystery there was,—about
Beck Edge and Field Howe. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
never been interested in the matter, and she
cared nothing about it now. But Maggie
was so interested that she couldn’t stop talking
about it. Her colour rose and her eyes shone.
Digging up vague details from a quite improbable
past, she proceeded to shape them into an
unreliable present. You might almost have
thought that she had a personal bias in the
affair; whereas the truth was that she had never
been nearer either of the houses than a crow’s
flight on a fine day.</p>

<p>Luke’s questions had been chiefly about the
staff,—who was working for his father, these
days, and what had happened to the rest. “I
always thought Nicholson wouldn’t last so
long,” he had said. “He was a bad egg,—sure!
Tommy Rigg’ll be getting an old man
now, and likely past his work. What? D’you
mean to say he’s been gone five year back and
more? Gosh! How time does scoot!”</p>

<p>He had said another thing after that which
had annoyed her sorely in the dream, and which
even in remembrance made her fume a little.</p>

<p>“Len Machell’s still hanging on, isn’t he?”
he had asked. “Father thought a lot of Len.
I never let on to you about it, Mother, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
once applied to me for a job. When we were
on our feet, it was, and he knew we’d something
to offer; but of course I told him that I
shouldn’t think of sniping him like that from
the old dad.”</p>

<p>She had been pretty short with him, she
remembered now,—had implied, whilst busy
commenting upon Machell’s “cheek,” that
there had been “cheek” on Luke’s part as
well. He had only laughed in his cheerful way,
and the dream had melted and changed, but
the flame of her indignation was still at work
within her. She had not known that she could
care so much about a thing like that, or that she
could resent so bitterly a slight on Kirkby. And
not only Kirkby himself, but Kirkby’s job,
which she had always imagined that she despised
and hated!... She was surprised by her
own attitude, and lay for some time brooding
over it. It was only with difficulty that she
reminded herself that it was “only a dream,”
and that in all probability Machell had never
applied at all.</p>

<p>Joe’s questions had been much the same as
Luke’s, with now and then a family resemblance
to some of Maggie’s. He, too, had wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
know about the staff, and who was now at the
Home Farm. But he had also wanted information
about some of his old-time sweethearts,
and that with his wife sitting by and not
looking over-suited!</p>

<p>“Where’s Bessie Dale, these days, Mother,
and Carrie Sharpe? Married long since, both
of them, I’ll be bound,—nay, don’t tell me
you’ve never heard! Carrie was a school-teacher,
you’ll think on, and Bessie in Morton’s
office. There was Dolly Dale, as well, but, of
course, <i>she</i> married Len Machell....” It
was queer how the Machells kept coming into
the dream!</p>

<p>She had done her best to suppress Joe, both
because of his wife’s crab-apple look, and
because of the hot little ache at the heart which
mothers feel at the mention of girls who have
wanted their sons. But he had refused to be
silenced, at first, and had gone on chattering
about Dolly. “Dolly was the best of the
bunch,” he had said, laughing, “and more
than a bit fond of yours truly. Len would
never have got her, I know that, if I’d stopped
at home instead of hitting the trail!”</p>

<p>But They had got tired at last of asking her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
about England,—even Joe, who saw it sunned
by the bright smiles of his lost lasses. They had
understood that she did not want to talk about
it, and had stopped teasing her, realising also
that she had very little to tell them. But it
had been impossible to explain that it had
ceased to be real to her as soon as she had left
it,—that she had clean forgotten such things
as that Machell had married Dolly!</p>

<p>It was Ellen, amazingly, who had been the
worst of all, because it was Ellen who had
asked about the house and gardens. This was
the more surprising because she had been the
one child who had seemed to share her mother’s
dislike of them. Many a pleasant chat they
had had together, abusing the dull, shut-in
place, and feeling greatly enlivened. And now
it was Ellen who was bringing it back to mind,
tying her down to it again when at last she was
safely shot of it!</p>

<p>“Have you got that extra window put in,
Mother, you were always so keen on? Does
the kitchen fire still smoke in a west wind?
Privet hedge’ll have grown to a grand size,
nowadays, I expect? Does the dad still grow
‘Creeping Jenny’ over the front door?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>She had tried hard to find answers for Ellen,
sitting on a stool at her knee, and fondly fingering
her skirt. There had been a distant look
in her eyes as she put her questions, as if her
mind had jumped to her mother’s side of the
ocean, as her mother’s had jumped to hers.
Mattie had felt it a trifle disloyal of Ellen to
have gone away, so to speak, the moment she
arrived. It was almost as if they had been
nearer together when those heaving miles of
Atlantic had lain between them....</p>

<p>But those were the only shadows which had
blurred the exquisiteness of the dream, and the
effect of them, after all, had been to make it
even more real. For, as she had to admit,
those were the very questions that They <i>would</i>
ask, Over There, until their excitement over
their parents’ arrival had sobered down a little.
Later on, too, they would ask, at intervals,
again, for even in the busiest lives there are
hours when, the body quiet, the mind insists
upon travelling. But she would not mind it
so much, then.... It was only Ellen who had
given her something of a shock,—whose questions,
now that she came to think of them,
did not seem quite real.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The rest of the experience, however, had been
pure joy, so full of laughter and sweet looks
and tender touches that it seemed as if the sensation
of them must last for ever. There were
the grandchildren, too,—but she must give
an hour or two, later, to thinking about them.
They were too many, and too dear, to be hurried
over when she ought to be getting up and seeing
to Kirkby’s breakfast.</p>

<p>But the biggest thing in the dream had been
the feeling of escape,—together with that
exhilarating sense of space after which she had
always hankered, without rhyme or reason.
Other places, no doubt, could have given her
that same sense, but it was Canada that had
captured her imagination. Canada as a whole
seemed to have got into the dream, with its
strong air, its mountains and lakes, and its
long stretches of land reaching to the great
line of its horizon. She thought of prairies
and woods, and great rivers, and ice-bound
harbours. She saw the glint of gold, and dog-sledges
racing over frozen country. She saw
the soft colours of ripened orchards, and a fresh
wind running for miles over the stooping heads
of wheat.... All that she had heard and read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
about the Dominion seemed to have merged
into one single setting for that keen adventure
of her spirit.</p>

<p>It had all been wonderful beyond imagining,
joyful beyond ecstasy; perfect,—no, not quite
perfect. There had been just one thing lacking,—one
person who had not been present.
Kirkby was not in the dream....</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE was still wondering why Kirkby was
not in the dream when she had got herself
out of bed and was beginning to dress quickly,
although not so quickly as she was in the habit
of dressing, for her limbs felt heavy, this morning,
as if her body also had travelled in the night.
Her mind, too, was still inclined to wander,
so that at intervals she found herself losing
touch with what she was doing. In the very
act of fastening button or tape, sewn on with
that efficient sureness which was her distinguishing
characteristic, she would pause to answer
some question put by a voice which could not
be less than three thousand miles away.</p>

<p>She felt disconcerted by the fact that Kirkby
had apparently had neither lot nor part in last
night’s expedition. She was also rather glad,
with a queer, jealous gladness which she did
not understand, and which made her slightly
ashamed. But his absence not only detracted
from the reality of the dream; it rather frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
her. The superstition always dormant at
the back of the country mind rose up to persuade
her that Kirkby would never live to cross
the ocean with her.</p>

<p>But the shadow soon passed, as the other
shadows had passed, and the rush of excitement
returned more headily than ever. She
even sang as she dressed, and then stopped
with a laugh, feeling that even the walls of the
house must come alive to hear her. She was
the type of woman who sings naturally as she
moves about, but the number of times she had
sung in that house she could count on her ten
fingers.... Not only had she not had the
heart to sing in a place so hostile to her, but it
would have seemed to her rather false, implying
to all who might hear it that she was beginning
to “settle down.”</p>

<p>She had not known that she was going to
dislike the place when she first came to it;
indeed, she had never even thought about it.
She had taken it for granted that she would
“settle,” as everybody else, apparently, settled.
She had been too young, at that time, to know
much about wives who wanted to “move on,”
although she had come across more than one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
(and thought nothing of them) in later life.
And she had certainly not known that the place
you lived in could be either your enemy or
your friend.</p>

<p>Yet she might have guessed that it would
not do for her to be dumped down just anywhere;
that, like so many of Kirkby’s precious
plants, she needed a special soil on which to
thrive. And at least she might have guessed
that she needed room.... Quite early on her
mother had noticed the fact, and commented
upon it.</p>

<p>“Look at her now,” Mattie could vaguely
recall her saying, pointing her out to some on-looker
as she sat at table, “pushing and shoving
at t’ pots till she’s got ’em away from her! She
did the same as a babby, and a sight o’ mugs she
broke an’ all! She can’t abide to be cluttered
up, or to have folks pressing on her, can’t our
Mattie.”</p>

<p>She had said the same to the school-teacher,
when, calling indignantly to demand the meaning
of some trifling punishment, she was told
that Mattie had insisted upon annexing more
of the school-bench than she was entitled to.</p>

<p>“She’ll never do as she’s meant if you don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
allow for it,” was her parting advice. “Best
give her two folks’ room, and then you’ll have
done with it. She’s a big child, to begin with,—as
fine a one as you’ll see anywhere, though I
says it as shouldn’t,—but it isn’t only that.
It’s just she can’t do with feeling she hasn’t
room to breathe and spread about in.”</p>

<p>Later on, of course, she had learned to adapt
herself better to the conditions in which she
lived, so that pots were no longer broken, or
schoolfellows thrust aside. But her love of
space continued to grow with her, although more
or less unconsciously, showing itself mainly in
a liking for long walks, and for open windows
and doors. It was during a dispute with her
mother over the latter that for once she had
caught a faint glimpse of the life for which she
was really intended. An aunt of hers had
been staying with them, who knew a little of
the world, and she had taken a hand in the
family quarrel.</p>

<p>“Folks can’t all think the same,” she had
said, in reply to the mother’s statement that,
“if our Mattie had her way, roof would be off
afore you could say Jack Robinson!” “They’re
different, all the world over. Your Mattie’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
likely do rarely in one o’ them new countries
they’re talking of opening up.”</p>

<p>Mattie’s mother had been altogether vague
upon the subject of “new countries,” having,
indeed, sufficient difficulty, as it was, in realising
that there was more of England beyond the one
little spot in which she lived and moved and
had her being.... “Eh, now! What countries?”
she had enquired incredulously, rather
as if she suspected the visitor of inventing them
on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>“Colonies, they call ’em,” the other had said
firmly, although almost equally vaguely, and
speaking the word as people spoke it in those
days, before such names as Canada and New
Zealand had become living realities to the public
mind. “Fine big spots wanting big strong
folk as like fresh air and a bit o’ work. Your
Mattie’d do grand for Colonies, from what they
tell me.”</p>

<p>“They’re big, d’you say?” Mattie herself
had asked, fixing upon the one point which had
intrigued her imagination, and in that one word,
had she but known it, assessing the whole of
her life’s trouble.</p>

<p>The visitor nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Big, every way, so I understand. Mountains
and rivers, and great pieces as they call—nay,
I can’t think on, except that I know it made
me think o’ church. Trouble is, though, they’re
such a sight of a long way off,—t’other side of
the ocean, though I’m sure I can’t say which.”</p>

<p>Mattie’s mother had laughed when the ocean
was mentioned, as though the very sound of
that awe-inspiring word had put a full stop
to the conversation.</p>

<p>“Nay, now, it’s no use your talking Colonies
to the lass, if there’s oceans and such-like mixed
up in it! She can’t abide the sea, can’t our
Mattie, and never could. I don’t know where
she gets it from, I’m sure, unless it’s my
mother, as was once right near drowned,
falling off a pier at Morecambe. She had a
terble down on the sea, after that, and I reckon
our Mattie’s the same. What, she can’t even
abide a picture of it in the room,—says it puts
her off her meat! Nay, if Colonies means
crossing the ocean and such-like, I reckon they’ll
have to do without our Mattie.”</p>

<p>Remembering this speech of her mother,
ominously clear as speeches seem which have
been long forgotten and then are suddenly recalled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
she felt disconcerted for the second time,
that morning. It was true, of course, that she
had always dreaded the sea. Every kind of evil
of which it was capable had seemed at one time
or another to fasten upon her imagination.
Accounts of shipwrecks held her as no other
literature had power to hold her,—tidal waves,
broken embankments, water-spouts moving like
monstrous spectres.... The sea was the only
thing in life which had so far been able to intimidate
her, and she had not yet mastered her
fear of it. Not easily would she forget those
bad days after her children had sailed, or the
unbelievable relief with which she had heard
that the ground was firm again under their
feet.</p>

<p>And now she was definitely committed to
cross that very ocean which had driven the
Colonies out of a cottage talk all those years
ago! Even in the midst of her luminous satisfaction
she shivered as she remembered it.
The sea frightened you, made you sick, heaved
you about, and then finally drowned you....
Not, of course, that she anticipated being
drowned,—the dream alone seemed surety
enough for that—but she knew that she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
suffer it a hundred times in her mind before
she was safely landed.</p>

<p>Yet it had to be faced if ever she was to know
the happiness that was waiting for her, Over
There.... She felt a pang of impatience
because she could not make the journey as she
had just made it in the night,—as she had made
it many and many a time over her cooking or
her needle. Yet what were a few days of misery,
after all, compared with the long heart-breaking
years through which she had struggled already?</p>

<p>The picture called up by her aunt had faded
as soon as it was painted, not only blotted out
by the terrors of the sea, but dwindling from
sheer vagueness. She had had that one hint
of a door wider than any of those which she
opened daily, and then it was closed again
before she could see beyond it. One glimpse,
followed by a single pang of recognition and
disappointment ... and presently she had
forgotten it. In any case, she would have had
little use for the Colonies, just then, for already
she was aware that she meant to marry Kirkby.</p>

<p>Looking back, she could see him coming
into her life as softly as the river mists which
lay so often upon the gardens, and which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
so much dreaded and hated. She could not remember
either the day she had first met him,
or the still more important day when he had
asked her to marry him. All that she knew was
that he had not been in her life, and then suddenly
he was all of it. She could no more
trace the moment when that had happened
than she had ever been able to catch a tulip
closing for the night.</p>

<p>She had neither hated nor dreaded Kirkby,
in spite of his home mists, and even now the
memory of their courtship had the power to
thrill her with its sweetness. But he had been
the wrong mate for her, nevertheless. He and
all that he represented had muffled her spirit
as the mists had muffled her body. The bold
driving-force that was in her had been irritated
by his reserved and delicate ways. It was
amazing that they had pulled together as well
as they had,—she always reaching outward,
and he always holding back. Many a couple
as badly suited would have parted company
before now.</p>

<p>She winced a little in her new happiness,
remembering how often she had felt bitterly
towards him. She was ashamed, now, of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
many quarrels.... In the great peace that
had come to her it seemed impossible that there
could ever have been anything but peace.
Even when they were not disputing, she had
raged against him in her heart. She flushed as
she recalled that she had actually sunk so low
as to try to set the children against him....</p>

<p>She flushed and she was ashamed, but these
troubles out of the past had already vanished
so far that they could not really hurt the
present. Already they were gone as the wrinkles
in a cloth were gone as soon as a hot iron was
passed upon them. With the new peace had
come to her also a new vision. She had not
meant to hurt Kirkby any more than he had
meant to hurt her. She would do her best to
make up to him for it in the little time that was
left to them Over There.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to her now that her mother,
who had read her so plainly when she was
small, had yet not seen fit to warn her when she
most required it. Perhaps she was one of those
people who could see things clearly in a child,
but never thought about them again directly
they grew up. Even if she had thought, she
would only have said that a good husband like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Kirkby was not to be sneezed at. Mattie
herself would have said it if a child of her own
had asked her. He was a decent, steady young
man in a job to which she was accustomed.
You did not sneeze at a man like that if you
had any sense of values.</p>

<p>She had not sneezed at him, and she was not
sneezing now, though she had sneezed often
enough at what he had had to offer. It was a
better position, of course, than might well have
fallen to her lot; a better one, for instance,
than had fallen to her sisters. It was not
Kirkby’s fault that the longing with which she
had been born had finally got on her mind; and
it was certainly her fault, if it was anybody’s,
that the children had been born with it, too!</p>

<p>She opened the window before going downstairs,
her glance falling, as she did so, on the
privet hedge, and she was amazed by the sudden
rush of affection which took her as she looked
at it. The shadows were still on the little lawn
which it sheltered, giving it that air of seclusion
for which it had been planned. A flower-bed
ran all round the lawn under the hedge, and
in the middle of the grass was another bed
with a standard rose. At one end of the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
plot was a rustic seat, set with its back to the
rest of the gardens and its face towards the
west.</p>

<p>The Mattie looking out of the window saw
many Matties walking in that little plot, and
making it, by dint of years of dreaming, into an
orchard of escape. She saw a young Mattie,
first of all, and a little hedge, too thin and too
small to fend off the curious glances of the men
working close at hand. But the years fled
before her mind little faster than they had fled
in actual truth. Almost before you could turn
round there was an older Mattie and an older
hedge, with flowers in the trim border and a
green closeness about the lawn. And presently
both Mattie and the hedge were growing old
and stout, and the turf had grown thick and
soft, and there was a snug richness about the
soil....</p>

<p>The little place, where, as she had told
Kirkby, she was able to “get away,” had very
soon become the real centre of her married
life. To it she had taken both her early discontent
and her later bitterness of frustration.
Many a hard speech, which otherwise might
have been Kirkby’s portion, had been tossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
off at the privet hedge; many a salt tear had
been wept into that lawn! Sitting and sewing
in it, she had been a girl again, in her home
towards the west. Walking in it, with her
Canadian letters in her hand, the tiny spot had
resolved itself into that broad country where
her soul went free.</p>

<p>Going to Canada would, of course, mean
leaving that little home of memories behind her.
Somebody else would have the right to walk
in it, to sit and sew and dream.... She felt
a jealousy that was almost fierce as she thought
of that somebody, and her throat contracted
a little. If it had been possible, she would have
gathered up the lawn and the privet hedge, and
taken them away with her.</p>

<p>She continued to feel amazed by her sudden
feeling for the place; or, rather, by the sudden
revelation that it meant so much to her. She
had thought of it only as a refuge, a makeshift
for want of anything better, and now it had
become something that actually belonged to
her. She tested herself, looking away from it
and then back to it again, and felt always the
same rush of affection and the same jealous
ache. She had always thought that she hated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
every inch of the ground on which her married
life had been spent; but in spite of herself
these few square yards of it had stolen into her
heart.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only, she thought, that the
place looked different because she was leaving
it. It was a well-known fact that people often
regretted even the worst of things when the
time came for them to part with them. (Why,
she had had a cousin of her own with a broken
leg, who had cried when her crutches had been
taken away from her!) Or else it was just
because she had not been free that she had not
been able to see things properly. It was her
mind, even more than her body, that had been
in chains, and now she had shaken the chains
from her. Perhaps she was seeing things now
as she would see them in Canada, when at last
she had got away from them....</p>

<p>She went downstairs, still thinking about the
privet hedge, and feeling her first ecstasy a
little tarnished. She knew now, what she had
not realised before, that, in spite of the joy
that was coming, there were things that would
make her suffer. She had fondly imagined
that she had paid for the joy long since, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
apparently she had been wrong. Life was
piling its debts against you all the time....
Already there had been the questions and the
thought of the sea; and now had come the
shock of the privet hedge. They would plant
another hedge for her, if she wanted it, Over
There, but they could not ensure her another
forty years in which to watch it growing. They
could not make each leaf and twig speak to the
memories of a whole life. They could not give
her back the English soil which she had salted
and watered with her tears.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT even before she set foot in the kitchen
her mind had recovered its tone. The mere
fact of rapid movement, of swift passage from
one room to another, had, as always, the power
to cheer her. As for the letter, the presence of
which had so intimidated Kirkby that it had
taken him at least half an hour to look at it, she
found it little less than a magic spell. To see
it lying there on the table was almost to hear
her children’s voices bidding her good morning,
to meet their faces turned towards her as she
entered, and to feel the warm reality of their
hands.</p>

<p>So far, at least, Kirkby had not repented of
his decision, she thought, relieved, finding a
fresh resting-place for the precious object.
He had let the letter lie.... It was true, of
course, that he had seemed to have no regrets
when he came to her upstairs, but you could
not always tell. There was time, as she had
just proved, for a whole change of heart between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
the first stair and the last. And he had never
really wanted to go, in spite of his hankering
after that distant garden and a fresh sight of
his lads.</p>

<p>He had never yet broken a promise to her
that she could remember; yet she knew that she
would feel a good deal happier when the letter
had really gone. For a moment she thought
of stamping it and giving it to the postman
if he should happen to call, but abandoned
the idea instantly. Kirkby, as she knew, would
prefer to give it in by hand. In these out-of-the-way
places it was still considered insulting
to persons of high degree to send them a letter
of that sort through the post.</p>

<p>There would be other letters for the post,
anyhow, she thought gleefully, as she prepared
breakfast. Letters to her sisters, telling them
that she was leaving England ... to one or
two old friends still surviving in the neighbourhood
of her home. Letters about passages
and passports ... about her single tiny investment....
Above all, the great letter to
Them, Over There, announcing their speedy
coming.</p>

<p>She would write to Luke, she supposed, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
being not only the eldest of the family, but the
head of the firm. It was to his house that they
would probably go, until their own could be
got ready for them. But she had it at the back
of her mind that she would write to Ellen, as
well. Ellen was the one who would be the most
pleased about it, she thought fondly, if it was
fair to say that any one of them would be more
pleased than the others.</p>

<p>The phrasing of the letter, some of it new,
but most of it so old as to have become almost
mechanical, raced and hammered through her
brain to a triumphant close, only to begin again
the moment it was finished. Always she saw
it written, not in ink, but in scrolled and burnished
gold; with certain extracts, such as “see
you again,” “really coming,” and “hoping to
find you as this leaves me,” rising above the
rest like rocks in a golden sea.</p>

<p>She had had moments when she had thought
that a quieter method would be more appropriate
to the occasion,—a few, quiet, colourless
sentences, easily filled in by those to whom they
were sent. She had waited so long and so
bitterly that it seemed almost indecent to make
a song about it.... But now that the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
had actually arrived she was too happy to be
restrained and tasteful. The only letter that
would satisfy her would be vivid and underlined,
with exclamation-marks scattered here
and there like little shouts of joy.</p>

<p>The quieter method, however, would do excellently
for her sisters and the few old friends.
Too great a show of excitement would seem out
of place to them. They would sympathise, of
course, with her desire to see her children, but
otherwise they would be sure to think that she
was making a mistake. Folks who never
moved more than a yard from their own spots
all their lives always did think that others who
moved a yard or two further were making a
mistake.</p>

<p>In any case, they had always been inclined
to think her “a bit wild,” although why it
should be considered “wild” to want to live
in one country rather than another it was
difficult to see. Anyhow, it was lucky for the
Empire that somebody had been wild enough
to do it sometimes! Occasionally she had tried
to point this out both to the sisters and the
friends, but she had never convinced them that
it applied to her personally. Perhaps the folks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
among whom you were brought up never did
understand that things might apply to you just
as much as to the people outside.</p>

<p>No doubt the neighbours here had thought
her “a bit wild,” too, and discussed her disapprovingly
over their tea-cups. The village
was a small one, little more than a hamlet set
on the edge of the park, and no member of the
limited community would be likely to escape
its gossip. The thought of their shaken heads
did not distress her, however, for she had found
them a kindly enough lot, on the whole. More
than one of them would have a good word for
her, she knew, when the message got round to
them that she was leaving them for ever.</p>

<p>She had known some of them now for nearly
forty years, and yet there was not one among
them she could really call a friend. They were
on good enough terms, of course,—such terms
as other people would undoubtedly call friendship;
but in this, as in other things, she had
asked more of life than it had so far seen fit
to give her. A friend was a person you settled
down with, side by side, and whose life dovetailed
into yours as board dovetailed into board.
She had never been able to have a friend like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
that because she had never been able to settle
down. Always she had lived like someone
starting on a journey, for whom at any moment
the signal may be dropped.</p>

<p>It was not only that, in her first years of
homesickness and revolt, she had not cared to
know the people in the place; or that, having
come from a village which was the hereditary
enemy of this, she was naturally disposed to
dislike its inhabitants. There was jealousy
between villages as bitter and lasting as there
ever was between individuals. Nobody knew
what started it, as a rule, or why it persisted
from generation to generation. But the moment
the people from these two places happened to
get together, there was bound to be trouble.
Before you could turn round, they were at
work belauding themselves and belittling each
other, whether it was about football or the
quality of the land or the amount of money
in the Sunday collection-bag.</p>

<p>Kirkby had been not only too gentle but too
much in love to make trouble of that kind,
although she herself had made it unashamedly
in their quarrels. But that particular feeling
of animosity had died in her to some extent as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
time went on. The real bar to friendship had
been the fear of being tied down,—the necessity
for keeping herself free against the hour when
she should go.</p>

<p>Well, she had not tied herself down, and for
all those years of keeping herself aloof from
people she would find herself repaid. There
would be no tears on either side when the time
came to say good-bye. She would be able to
slip away without bitterness or regret, without
a single pull at her heart, or a hand snatching
at her own.</p>

<p>She would be sorry to part with some of them,
all the same, even though there would be no
sharpness about the sorrow. Things came back
to her now which had long since dropped away,
but which had touched her nearly, at the time.
Kindnesses, which, for the time being at least,
had seemed to make life brighter.... Gifts
with the kind of thought behind them that was
better than any gift.... Jokes which had
stayed persistently in her mind, and made a
sort of laughter there, even if it could not reach
her lips.</p>

<p>And other things, infinitely more poignant,
which, impossible as it seemed, she was beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
to forget.... That year when Ellen had
nearly died, and Mrs. Grisedale had come unasked
to help her with the nursing.... She
could still see her face as she bent over the sick
child, could hear the note in her voice to which,
as to an actual arm, both she and Ellen had
clung. She had done her best to repay the
kindness, although she had not maintained the
intimacy, and she had thought the matter
cleared. But she knew now that, when the time
came for saying good-bye to Mrs. Grisedale,
she would also have to say good-bye to the
bitter-sweet memory of which she was a part.</p>

<p>The things which you did for others were even
worse in rising up against you at farewell
moments.... It was she herself to whom
Mrs. Ellwood had clung, during those first
bad weeks after the poor thing had lost her
husband. Ignoring her own people, she had
asked firmly for Mattie, and Mattie had gone
to her, as one always did go, in these cases.
They had drifted apart long since, but they
would remember when she said good-bye....
She felt absurdly that she was in some way
forsaking Mrs. Ellwood, even though for twenty
years at least they had been nothing more to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
each other than just ordinary good neighbours.</p>

<p>No doubt she would have other if lesser
pangs to bear before she was finished with her
acquaintance. Of course, it was open to her
to go without saying good-bye at all, but she
was not willing to slink off as if ashamed of
what she was doing. The pangs would be lost
soon enough in the happiness ahead of her.
But she saw once again that, no matter what
you paid, there was always something to pay.
No matter how you kept yourself free of life,
life would never leave you free....</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE passed with a sigh of relief to the thought
of all that would have to be done before
she could get away. Her heart rose to the task
as she remembered it. Work,—and especially
organising work,—had always been a pleasure
to her, and this would mean more than pleasure.
In the rush of planning and packing, of solving
the many problems which would undoubtedly
arise, she would easily lose sight of the few
burdens that were weighing on her spirit.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, she had no intention
of beginning to pull the house to pieces,
or even of starting upon such minor operations
as going through drawers and cupboards.
There would be no sense in making the place
uncomfortable before she was obliged. The
day would be full enough, as it was, what with
the ordinary routine and the letters which had
to be written; not to speak of the long hours
of dreaming and gloating to which she would
certainly fall captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>There would be plenty to do, of course, when
the moment arrived, but it would be done all
right, and done like so much clockwork. In
any case, her house, always in order and always
clean, was not the sort that had almost to be
built over again before it was fit to leave. It
was not overcrowded, either, with those things
which accumulate as the years go on, so unconsciously,
sometimes, that they seem to have
grown out of the very stuff of life itself. Broadly
speaking, she was almost as free of unnecessary
belongings as a seabird poised for flight on
the edge of a naked cliff.</p>

<p>Yet almost without knowing what she was
doing she was setting her hand to the lever which
Fate had so tardily thrust into it. Even while
she was making the breakfast she was moving
a few things here and there, rejecting this and
accepting that, and hunting for paper and string
with which to pack them. It was more than
likely that they would have to be unpacked
again, later on, even if, in a future scheme of
things, they were not left behind altogether.
But the excitement of putting the work in train
was impossible to resist. With each parcel
she packed her heart rose a little higher. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
change in the standing order of things was an
added assurance that that order was at an end.</p>

<p>The desire to alter it even further grew upon
her when breakfast was over and Kirkby had
returned to his duties. A great restlessness
possessed her. It was almost as if the long
strain of waiting for what she wanted had sapped
her power to believe in it when it came; as if
she feared that, unless she instantly took advantage
of it, it might still manage to evade her....</p>

<p>It was this fear that drove her to shifting the
furniture, to dragging out hidden treasures,
and reducing the house generally to a chaotic
state worse even than in the yearly whirlpool
of spring-cleaning. Pushing and tugging, she
performed feats of strength which she had
thought beyond her, even in youth, and which
sent her gasping to a chair for a few moments’
relaxation. She raced up and down stairs
fetching and carrying, and then did not know
what to do with things, and had to take them
back again. The tide of life within her rose
to its fullest height in the necessity for proving
to herself that at last the longed-for miracle had
been accomplished.</p>

<p>She was standing on a chair by the dresser,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
measuring the pot-rail with a tape, and in constant
danger of losing her balance in her efforts,
when the postman’s whistle came shrilling up
to her as he climbed towards the gardens. In
the sudden start that it gave her she lost count
of what she was doing, and, getting down rather
stiffly, she went to the door to wait for him.</p>

<p>For how many years now, she said to herself,
still flushed and panting, had she listened,
morning by morning, for Dick Nelson’s whistle!
For how many years now had it had power to
thrill her, carrying with it, as it so often did,
the possibility of a Canadian letter! Even
when there was no chance of such a thing it
could set her heart leaping and her eyes shining.
The single, climbing note of it had always been
for her a call straight from the Great Beyond.</p>

<p>So many mornings she had longed and listened,
and now she could almost count on her
fingers the mornings that were left! She
wondered whether she would still find herself
listening when she was over the water,—going
to the door, perhaps, to stand waiting and
watching. It would be some time, no doubt,
before she would get used to doing without
those constant letters. She had lived for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
so long that the loss of them at first would be
almost like the loss of meat and drink.</p>

<p>She would not need them, of course, when
she had the children,—so much nearer and
dearer than any letter could make them!—but
she would miss them, all the same. There
were things people told you in letters which
they never told in the flesh; things they felt
for you when they wrote which they did not
think of when you were by. And, once written,
you had them to turn to, even if they never
said them again. The very handwriting of
those who loved you was in itself a loving
speech....</p>

<p>The postman was getting nearer now, she
could tell, and he had not whistled again. He
had known for many a year now that he did not
need to whistle more than once when it came
to Mrs. Kirkby!... Like a wise man, he
was saving his breath for the last steep little
pull that led to the gardens. She could hear
him wheezing and puffing, as it was, and the
shuffle of his step which betrayed the slow
lifting of his feet. Dick Nelson was getting old,
she thought idly, and then remembered with
a start that he was the same age as herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
She knew that was so because he had told her
his age on his last birthday, and, looking at his
wrinkles and his bowed back, she had been
startled, even then. To-day, listening to his
puffing and pausing as he climbed the gardens
path, she was more than startled. To-day,
faced as she was with new conditions which
would make such trial of her strength, Dick’s
loss of vigour seemed an actual menace.</p>

<p>She tried to console herself with the thought
that age was purely a personal matter, and that
people did not necessarily grow old at the same
rate because they were born on the same day.
Dick, as she knew, had been a weakling in his
youth, whereas she had never known ache or
pain. A walking-post’s job was a trying one,
too, especially in this northern climate....
Nevertheless, she found it an effort to look at
him as he came in at the little gate.</p>

<p>He was still wheezing as he stopped in front
of her, and, diving into his bag, produced a flat
packet, which she saw to be addressed to her
in Ellen’s writing. He fumbled a little with it
before he handed it over, and for the moment,
curiously enough, she felt no impulse to take
it from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Another letter from your folks, Missis,”
Dick said, with the familiarity of the old country
postman, which pays for itself by a genuine
sympathy in either joy or sorrow. “It should
ha’ been here yesterday, but I took it to Mrs.
Crosby’s, by mistake.”</p>

<p>Mattie looked rather vexed at that, both
because she did not like Mrs. Crosby, and
because she was unaccountably troubled by
the sudden appearance of the packet.</p>

<p>“I should think it <i>was</i> a mistake!” she
answered him rather sharply, though at the same
time trying to tone down her reproof for the
sake of old acquaintance. “There’s not much
likeness between Kirkby and Crosby that I
can see!”</p>

<p>“Nay, nor between the folks, neither!”
Dick chuckled, setting her flushing again,
though now it was from flattered vanity instead
of anger. Mrs. Crosby was a thin little rat
of a woman, with a red head and a blue nose,—about
as different a person from Mattie as you
could find in a day’s march.... Dick might
be stupid and short of breath, she reflected,
softening, but he still knew a fine woman when
he came across one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“It’s my eyes, d’ye see?” he was saying,
when she attended to him again, and emphasising
his remarks with sharp flaps of the Canadian
packet. “I’ll have to be seeing about getting
glasses. Anyhow, the letter’s here all right,
and none the worse for a bit of extra travelling....
It’ll be a likeness, I reckon, from the
look of it,” he finished, handing it to her at last
with an air of making a concession.</p>

<p>It probably <i>was</i> a likeness, Mattie told him,
holding it in her hands with the same curious
sense of reluctance in her fingers. She might
have told him more but for that remark of his
about his eyes, reminding her as it did of the
increasing disadvantages of age. Dick had seen
many a snapshot of her family in his time, and
had not thought twice about giving his own
opinion of them, either.... “My folks Over
There are always sending me something to
look at.”</p>

<p>“They’ll not be sending much longer, if all
tales is true!” Dick’s eyes seemed keen enough
now, as they lifted themselves, twinkling.
“There’s barely a house I call at but somebody
asks me when Mrs. Kirkby’s off to
Canada!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Mattie laughed in return, but with a slight
nervousness that surprised her. She had only
to mention the “notice,” and the whole place
would be agog, making it, with every reference
to the subject, more certain and more “real.”
But something, which she took to be loyalty
to Kirkby, held her back from speaking. “Ay,
well, and what d’you say to that?” she compromised,
by way of answer.</p>

<p>Dick shifted his bag and shuffled his feet,
finally clearing his throat like one preparing
for an oration.</p>

<p>“Well, if you want to know, ten year ago
I said you’d be off as sharp as a dog to its
kennel. Five year ago, I said—‘Ay, well, less
likely things has happened.’ But to-day, when
they ax me, I say I wouldn’t believe it even if
I was to see it.”</p>

<p>The colour rose higher yet in Mattie’s face,
but the thing that lay close in her heart was too
warm for a show of temper.</p>

<p>“Whatever makes you say that?” she
queried innocently.</p>

<p>For the first time Dick showed signs of discomfort,
turning about a little, and looking
away from her. “Nay, it’s just that you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
not so young, these days,” he returned at last,
bravely. “Same age as myself, I’ve heard my
old mother say, and you’d not catch <i>me</i> crossing
t’ ocean if you give me Canada!”</p>

<p>“Folks are as young as they feel,” Mattie
said, trying to repress the pang which had
seized her when he mentioned the ocean.
“The sea’s nothing to me! As for age and such-like,
there’s folks go abroad when they’re a deal
older than us. What, I remember Mrs. Dugdale
going off to New Zealand when she was nigh
on ninety!”</p>

<p>“Ay, but they go sudden-like,” Dick said,
wrinkling his brow as if to help the working
of his brain. “They don’t sit planning a sight
o’ years. Things is sudden-like when they’re
meant.”</p>

<p>“Things always seem sudden when they
come,” Mattie retorted briskly. “Planning
makes no difference. Look how folks know
they’re going to die from the very minute
they’re born, and yet they’re mighty surprised
about it when it happens!”</p>

<p>“Folks don’t plan to die.... Leastways,
them as does seldom brings it off. And that
brings me back like to what I was trying to say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
If you stop over long on the edge of a jump
you take root afore you think.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t have much root to bother about
if I go to Canada!” Mattie laughed. “Saving
your presence, Mr. Nelson, there’s precious
little I’d mind leaving behind.”</p>

<p>The old postman shook his head.</p>

<p>“You strike roots afore you know. Everything
as you do each day is a root o’ some sort.
Even folks as has been in prison knows what it
is to strike roots.”</p>

<p>The privet hedge came into Mattie’s mind,
together with that past look on Mrs. Grisedale’s
face, and the clinging touch of Mrs. Ellwood’s
hand.... But she laughed again.</p>

<p>“They’re roots as is easy pulled up, I should
say!” she said cheerfully. “Folks in prison,
I mean.... As for me, I’ve always been on
the go, so to speak. I’ve never settled down.”</p>

<p>“You can’t <i>not</i> settle!” Dick said suddenly,
in a loud voice that was almost threatening.
“Don’t you make any mistake, Mrs. Kirkby.
Life settles you. Time settles you. You can’t
<i>not</i> settle!”</p>

<p>The annoyance she had been keeping in
check rose at that to a strong head, but it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
succeeded almost at once by a feeling of pity.
Dick looked so old, standing there, weighed
down by his heavy bag, and with the fine spring
sunlight showing up his wrinkles. He was
jealous, she said to herself, because he felt old,
and because, perhaps, he, too, had wanted to
go to Canada. She could have laughed now
at the thought that they were the same age.
In the pride of her new joy she felt like a girl
beside him,—a girl with her strength to draw
at, and the whole wide world before her.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, I don’t see as we need quarrel
about it,” she said amiably. “Likely what
you say’s right most of the time, if it isn’t
always. Anyway, Canada or no Canada, it’s
a bonny morning!”</p>

<p>But Dick was already shambling away towards
the office, wheezing as he went, and grumbling
to himself as an old dog grumbles when he
meets a young one. She smiled as she saw him
stumble over a stone, and stop in a rage to kick
it from him. Thrusting the letters in at the
office with a shaky hand, he swung about
crossly and disappeared round a corner of the
building.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">V</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH the smile still on her lips, Mattie
turned herself round and went back into
the kitchen. Dick was a grumpy old thing, she
thought cheerfully, and, like many other old
people, firmly convinced that his dismal view
of life was the only possible one. But she could
not help feeling sorry that he had gone away
in a rage. On a day that should have been
joy from dawn to set, she did not like to think
that she had had even the shadow of a dispute
with such an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>She would miss Dick’s constant visits when
she had got to the other side, his grumpiness
and his whistle, and his rough, outspoken
comments. It would be a bit of a nuisance,
too, to have to get used to dealing with new
tradespeople. Shopfolk took a lot of getting to
know, wherever you happened to be, but she
had long since got the better of hers. The
grocer would never dream, nowadays, of sending
her any but the right bacon, the right sugar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
the right tea. As for the butcher, he had long
ago given up trying to palm off on her any
piece of meat except the one that she happened
to ask for. It was a triumph to have got as far
as that with a butcher, as anybody could tell
you, and one that could hardly be achieved
twice within the limits of a lifetime. She
had a distinct feeling of dismay when she
thought of having to start again with a fresh
butcher.</p>

<p>Ellen’s packet was still in her hand, and she
stood looking down at it without attempting
to open it. For the first time in her life she had
not been altogether pleased to see Ellen’s
handwriting, and she could not understand it.
At sight of it she had had a sensation of interference
affecting her almost to physical recoil.
She had been so near to her children during the
night that a message arriving so soon afterwards
seemed bound to break the spell. Nor was the
position bettered by the fact that the packet
should have reached her the day before. There
was something casual yet calculated about its
coming this morning which seemed to jar the
serene procession of ordained events. Ellen
ought to have known, she found herself saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
senselessly, that after last night there was no
need to keep sending packets any more.</p>

<p>It was a photograph that she held, she felt
sure of that, and one for which she had long
been waiting. Among the many snapshots
arriving year by year there had never been one
of Ellen, arm in arm with a husband, or half
hidden behind a baby. She had never “taken”
well, even in her youth, and, once over the water,
had firmly refused to be “taken” at all. Always
she had resisted her mother’s demands in that
light, laughing way of hers which seemed to
bring her so closely to you. No photograph,
so Mattie had often felt, could possibly seem
more real than the Ellen who came to you with
her letters.</p>

<p>She had continued to ask for one, nevertheless,
and at long last had come the news that it
would shortly be forthcoming. Ellen had
written an amusing account of her visit to the
photographer’s and of her sufferings during
the proceedings. The result, however, it seemed,
had been an unexpected success, and should
presently be forwarded to her mother. Mattie
had watched for that precious packet as a hen
waits and watches for a hatching chicken. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
could not have been more thrilled, she sometimes
thought, if it had been Ellen herself who was
coming through the post!</p>

<p>That excitement had paled now beside the
vividness of the dream, as well as the greater
interest of the new position. She looked at the
parcel with indifference, almost with dislike
... certainly with impatience, as at a thing
come at the wrong time. She would open it
later on, she said to herself, as she laid it down,
and returned with a lightened heart to her
measuring of the dresser.</p>

<p>Passing from that to other even more entrancing
speculations, she was soon wrapped again
in the atmosphere which Dick and the packet
between them had temporarily dispelled. She
forgot them both as she toiled and planned,
stopping every now and then to remember
Kirkby’s dinner. Strung up though she was,
and therefore sensitive to the least touch of
trouble, she was still too high on the wave of
success to be disheartened for long together.</p>

<p>Even when she had begun her absurd game
with the furniture, that childish but charming
pretence in the midst of which Machell had
come upon her, she had not remembered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
photograph. Moving again in the dream, she
was able to turn even blocks of wood into
the dear ones who had peopled it, so that they
could scarcely have been more real to her if
they had been present in the flesh. The little
stool in her arms had held the warmth of a
living child; the grandfather’s clock had been
more surely Ellen than the packet she had
put away.</p>

<p>The sight of Machell smiling in at the door
had no power to disillusion her. Machell did
not annoy her, as Dick had done, by over-cocksure
assertions that it was now too late to
change. On the contrary, he was full of encouragement
and congratulation, and anxious
to know her plans. You would almost have
thought, she said to herself, chuckling, that he
was as glad of the move to Canada as she was
herself!</p>

<p>Her spirits mounted still further as the sun
mounted, and the day grew in clarity and
beauty. Like all country-bred folk, she was
susceptible to the influence of the weather,
even when she was not consciously aware of it.
Even when she was most withdrawn in mind
from the atmosphere around her, she was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
swayed by its many changes. The coming-out
of the sun was a trumpet-call to her vitality,
even if the note that it sounded was one of
clamorous rebellion. A grey day had the power
to chill her passion almost to fainting, even if
neither it nor any other-coloured day was able
to slay it altogether.</p>

<p>In her state of heightened sensibility she
could not have failed to notice the conditions
about her, but there was a good deal more to
it than that. The miraculous way in which
the barriers between herself and the place
seemed to have broken down continued to
surprise her. Now, when she looked out, she
had a distinct sensation of pleasure, as well as
that warmth of recognition which comes from
loved association. It seemed impossible to her
now that she could ever have regarded her home
with horror and dislike. The garden walls
and the paths gave her a sense of satisfaction
which seemed to have the satisfaction of many
years behind it. The tree-tops against the sky
produced a thrill of joy suggesting a long chain
of similarly sweet moments.</p>

<p>It was the same with the house, which she
had so long thought of as a prison, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
had suddenly become a place of pleasantness
and peace. For the first time in forty years she
realised it as peculiarly and joyfully her own.
She felt an impulse to sing as she saw the
sunlight lying across the kitchen floor. Up in
her bedroom the flowered wallpaper was printed
with memories, like a book.</p>

<p>She did not know whether to be glad or sorry
about the change, but it continued to amaze
her. She tested it, as she had tested her
sudden view of the privet hedge, and found that
it stood it, as the privet hedge had stood it.
Room after room she found rich and filled with
the actual makings of her life. Each time that
she went to window or house-door, she saw
the view before her shine and smile.</p>

<p>It was while she was standing at the door
during one of these pauses for mingled puzzle
and rest that she saw Mrs. Machell coming
across the gardens. Mrs. Machell was a plump
little woman, full of bustle and talk, but there
was a lilt about her to-day which she had never
hitherto noticed. Also she looked from side
to side of her as she came, as if the place interested
her more than usual. The spring must
have got into Mrs. Machell’s blood, Mattie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
thought, adding the head-turning and the lilt
to the rest of her new puzzle.</p>

<p>It was some time, however, before the visitor
actually reached the house. Coming upon Len
at work among the raspberry canes, she stopped
to talk to him, and they stood laughing and
chatting together for several minutes. Mattie
frowned a little as she watched them, seeing
the fine spring day going and Kirkby’s best
workman idling. But she was still too happy to
be annoyed by a thing which, after all, was
hardly within her province, and she had nothing
but smiles for Len’s wife when she finally
approached her.</p>

<p>“It was good of you to come,” she began
blithely, as she led the way into the kitchen.
“I didn’t look for you so soon. There’s not
that much doing, yet awhile, of course, but I’m
fair aching for someone to talk to!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Machell laughed as she looked about
her at the chaotic state of things which had so
disgusted Kirkby. She was a fine, bright
little thing, Mattie thought, and Joe might have
done worse than marry her. Her cheeks were
still fresh, and the gold of her hair shone as
she took off her hat in a business-like manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
She was the same age as Joe, too, which meant
a couple of years older than Ellen.... Mattie
joined in the laugh with the heartiness of the
excellent housewife who for once in a lifetime
is found wanting.</p>

<p>“Ay, it looks like it, I’m sure,” she agreed,
in reply to Mrs. Machell’s remark that at all
events there seemed plenty to be going on with.
“I’ll be right grateful if you’ll help me to put
things straight. Kirkby was that sick about
’em at dinner, it fair went to your heart to see
him! A man minds a house being pulled about
a deal more than a woman.”</p>

<p>“They do that!” Dolly Machell nodded
wisely. “They make as much noise about it
as a dog being skifted from its kennel. I
daren’t so much as move a chair in our spot
but Len’s as uneasy as an earthquake!”</p>

<p>Mattie felt a prick in her pride that an under-gardener
should presume to indulge in the same
idiosyncrasies as distinguished Kirkby, but
she covered it hastily. “Ay, well, men must
be men,” she returned kindly, generously
admitting Len into at least that one category.</p>

<p>“I’d a feeling I must be doing something
right off,” she went on, conscious that the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
upset needed some explanation. “Of course,
I know it’s over early yet to be arranging about
the sale, but it won’t be trouble wasted. I
know a deal better where I am than when I
started in at things, this morning.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Machell stole a glance at her in the chair
into which she had sunk after taking her visitor
into the kitchen. Mattie was hardly conscious
that she had sat down, or that she was beginning
to feel the effects of the work and excitement
of the morning. But to Mrs. Machell weariness
was written plain in the lines of her flushed
face and the droop of her broad shoulders.
Loose strands of her hair were straying wildly
across her forehead. Her hands, resting heavily
in her lap, looked older than the rest of her.</p>

<p>“Then you’re really thinking of leaving,
Mrs. Kirkby?” Dolly asked, with a casualness
assumed to hide an inward tremor. “Len said
it was as certain as rent-day, but I said I didn’t
believe it.”</p>

<p>There came over Mattie the same reluctance to
commit herself to a definite statement as she
had felt when Dick’s hinting had put a similar
question. Indeed, now that she came to think
of it, she had not been definite even with Len.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
He had assumed certain things, that was all,
and she had allowed him to assume them.
It was only to herself and to Kirkby that she
had so far put into straight words the great
fact of their going.</p>

<p>“Well, it looks like it, I’ll give you that!”
she answered good-temperedly, though with
a touch of discomfort. “I’ll admit it looks
like it.... But I don’t know that it does to go
shouting things out over soon. There’s some
think you’ll likely spoil your luck that way
if you’re not careful.”</p>

<p>Dolly looked a little disconcerted for a
moment, and then laughed brightly.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, we’ll pretend it’s true, shall we?”
she said cheerfully. “Just make a game of it?
<i>That</i> can’t spoil your luck! We’ll pretend
you’re off to Canada, though you’re stopping
on just as usual.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” Mattie said, in a tone of obvious
relief. “We’ll just pretend.... Well, then,
my lass, if you want to know, we’re thinking
of getting away by nigh on the first boat that
can take us.”</p>

<p>“Eh, now, if that isn’t news!” Dolly played
up promptly, for all the world as if she had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
heard a suggestion of such a thing until that
moment. Her face glowed as she spoke, and
a faint astonishment took Mattie, as it had taken
her with Len, that anybody else should care so
much about the project....</p>

<p>“But you can’t get away that soon, can you?”
the younger woman went on. “There’s your
notice to give in, and folks to tell on the other
side. You’ll be having a sale, you said; there’ll
be that to settle. And likely there’ll be a thing
or two you’ll be wanting for the journey.”</p>

<p>Mattie felt a fresh twinge of surprise at this
smart summary of her private business, together
with a twinge of uneasiness as she remembered
the Hall letter. Kirkby must be reminded
about it, she thought, the moment he came in....
But she forgot it again instantly as she
began a recital of her plans, her hot face growing
hotter, and her hands moving restlessly. The
future became more and more real to her as she
talked, just as it had been made more real by
the mere moving of the furniture. She found
herself telling Dolly not only about the measuring
and the packing, but about the conditions
and people awaiting her over the water. She
was not always quite certain whether what she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
was relating existed in point of fact or only in
last night’s dream, but it did not matter.
Such discrepancies as there might be counted
for nothing in the main immensity of her
statement.</p>

<p>Dolly made the most satisfying listener that
anybody could desire, her own hands twitching
and her own eyes shining. “It’s like a fairy-story,
I’m sure!” she declared, when at last
the other, short of further facts for the time
being, was beginning to repeat herself. “I’ve
heard a deal about Canada, one way and another.
My cousin, Jessie Bowness married, this last
year, and went out to the same part as your
Ellen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ay?” Mattie replied indifferently,
getting somewhat heavily to her feet. “Help
me shove this cupboard back again where it
come from, there’s a good lass.”</p>

<p>“She lives near Ellen an’ all,” Dolly went
on, setting her sturdy little shoulder to the
cupboard. “She’s moved there just lately.
She doesn’t see much of her, she says, as they’re
both so throng, but she sends me news of her
every now and then.”</p>

<p>Mattie said, “Oh, ay?” again, as some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
answer seemed to be needed, but every letter
of the little phrase bristled defensively. She
had the same impression of interference as at
the sight of Ellen’s packet, the same sensitive
fear of being twisted from her path....
“Lend me a hand with this table now,” she
continued quickly, hoping that Dolly’s cousin
Jessie might drop out of the conversation.</p>

<p>But Dolly had no intention of parting with
such an asset until she had added her utmost
to the interest of the occasion. She was too
much absorbed by her own prospects to be
greatly aware of another person’s reactions, as
well as too highly excited to refrain from talking.
Moreover, she thought in all innocence that
Mrs. Kirkby would be only too glad to listen
to anything that she could tell her about
Canada. Her cousin Jessie, therefore, was so
much present with them during the afternoon,
that it seemed to Mattie sometimes she had only
to turn herself about in order to see her.</p>

<p>“Jessie isn’t best suited with Canada,”
Dolly said, when the table had been restored
to its place, and the articles which usually
reposed upon it had returned to grace it. “She
says it’s so different.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Different to what?” Mattie enquired,
affecting obtuseness from a growing sense of
annoyance. “I don’t rightly follow.”</p>

<p>“Different to England, she means, and the
things she’s been used to, over here. She says
there’s times she feels she might as well be in
the moon, it’s all so strange.”</p>

<p>“Well, and why shouldn’t it be?” Mattie
returned, slapping down a book with unnecessary
vehemence, and then discovering it to be
Kirkby’s mother’s Bible. “It’s like to be different,
isn’t it, seeing it started a deal later?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I told her that when she was complaining
about folks being scattered about like except
when you got to the big cities. But Jessie
was always the sort that liked a crowd, even if
it meant sitting on other folks’ knees or sleeping
three in a bed.... But it isn’t only that,”
she continued, when she and Mattie between
them had removed the packing-case from the
larder. “There’s the climate as well. She
says it’s that cold in the winter you could get
yourself frozen stiff before you’d know anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“I reckon <i>I’d</i> know all right, anyhow,”
Mattie retorted grimly, although not without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
an inward qualm. Her particular brand of
rheumatism, acquired by a lifetime spent in
damp gardens, was peculiarly if incongruously
susceptible to frost. “Ay, and if I was getting
melted, either, come to that!”</p>

<p>“Then there’s the houses,” Dolly said, her
plump hands busy all the time clearing and
straightening. “You should just hear her about
the houses! Them sort, you know, made of
bits of wood, as you build yourself? Hen-hulls,
Jessie says they are,—hen-hulls and
nothing else!”</p>

<p>The elder woman felt a cold wrath take possession
of her as she heard the precious house
of her dream described in this derogatory
manner. If Dolly’s cousin Jessie had indeed
been present at that moment, it would doubtless
have gone hard with her. As she was not,
Mattie was forced to content herself with glaring
across the kitchen at Dolly, who, however,
was busy putting a drawer in the dresser to
rights, and could not see her.</p>

<p>“No place to swing a cat, Jessie says, and
that ugly an’ all! She says she’d give the eyes
out of her head for a nice bit of mortared
stone. ‘Something like that grand cottage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
Mrs. Kirkby’s,’ she says, ‘up at the gardens at
the Hall.’ I once brought her up here on
a message or something, if you remember,
and she was that taken with this spot there was
no holding her.”</p>

<p>Mattie did not remember, as it happened,
and was, at that moment, as far as it was possible
to be from wishing to remember. Her
exasperation at the onslaughts of Dolly’s cousin
Jessie was only to be measured by her growing
sense of helplessness in face of them. She had,
however, just discovered something to say that
might possibly put her out of court for good
and all, when Dolly, passing to another drawer,
flowed steadily onward.</p>

<p>“As for the folks out there, she hasn’t a good
word to say for them, home or foreign! A lot
of bounders, she says,—barring always your
folks, you’ll understand, Mrs. Kirkby. The
shop-folk, Jessie says, are that impudent she can
bare bring herself to speak to them. Talk to
you like as if they’d known you all your life,
and call you ‘my dear’ as soon as look at you!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear anybody calling me ‘my
dear’ before I had asked ’em for it!” Mattie
said furiously, fingering a tea-cup with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
fierceness that she broke the handle. The
retainers connected with a big house have always
a curious sense of being a species apart, and in
spite of her rebellion she was not immune
from it.</p>

<p>“Likely Jessie did ask for it,” Dolly said
soothingly, though without turning to look at
her. “I always thought her a bit free....
But the things she says about the folks as belong
are nothing to what she says about the folks out
from England. They fair ruin the place, she says—barring
always your belongings, Mrs. Kirkby,
as I said before. They’re that stuck up, she
says, each of ’em trying to best the rest, that
you’d fair bust out laughing if you didn’t feel
that mad at ’em. I reckon Jessie’s done her
bit of sticking up as well, and it didn’t come off,
and that’s what makes her so wild.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why any of them should be
stuck up, I’m sure,” Mattie burst out before
she had time to think,—“folks as didn’t make
good over here, and thought another country’d
likely do the job!”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s what Jessie says, Mrs. Kirkby!”
Dolly said, looking at her now, and with
definite surprise. “Leaving their country for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
their country’s good, is how <i>she</i> puts it. But
I didn’t look to hear you saying the same, and
with your folks doing so well an’ all!</p>

<p>“Some on ’em,” she continued, before Mattie
could find breath to speak again, “make out
they were that swell at home you’d likely think
as they’d have brought their coronets with
them! There’s some Madisons, she says,
from over Witham way, as is that full of themselves
they can hardly walk. They tell folks
they had a big farm over here, with a pedigree
herd of the best; whereas everybody knows
they had nothing but a milk-round as was more
like a water-round, by a deal!”</p>

<p>But Mattie had had more than she could
bear for the time being of Jessie’s depressing
reflections. A fresh picture of Canada was
forming before her eyes, blotting out the fine-hued
image which she had made for her own
enchantment. Already its glamour was blurred
beneath Jessie’s touch, as frost-traceries are
blurred by the rub of a rough finger. She was
appalled, too, by her sudden, contemptuous
speech, with its astonishing infidelity to her
past beliefs. She had always thought of the
Canadian adventurers by the brave title of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
pioneers, and would have been proud to have
made one of their gallant company. It seemed
the last treachery of all that she should have
nursed that subtle contempt, so that in a
moment of idle annoyance it might set a
sneer upon her lips.</p>

<p>With a brusque movement she put an end
both to Mrs. Machell’s monologue and to her
final dealings with the dresser.</p>

<p>“Let’s get at t’ parlour now, if you don’t
mind,” she said, bustling before her into the
dismantled room. She was now just as anxious
to get the house put back to rights as she had
wanted, earlier on, to pull it all to pieces.
Subconsciously she was thinking that, when
the place was tidy again, the trouble that was
growing in her mind might possibly smooth
out, too....</p>

<p>The two women had a pleasant hour together
arranging the little-used furniture, over which
they spent more time than was necessary out
of sheer enjoyment. Mattie found Mrs. Machell
an entranced auditor as she dwelt upon its
merits, pointing out its beauty of shape or
gloss or the elegance of its handles. Pictures
and vases had their histories related at full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
length, succeeded by records of clocks and epics
of antimacassars. Dolly fingered and valued,
praised and exclaimed, wondering to herself
all the time how many of the precious objects
would come her way at the sale.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a bad time, I doubt, before I’ve
settled what we’re to take!” Mattie laughed,
handling her treasures more and more fondly
under Dolly’s appreciation. “I thought I’d
hardened my heart to part with some of them,
this morning, but now that I’m looking at ’em
again, I’m not so sure! There’s no sense,
though, in taking a chair-leg more than we’re
obliged. It’ll cost enough, as it is. I doubt,
anyhow, I’ll have to make up my mind to leave
pictures and knick-knacks behind.”</p>

<p>Dolly’s heart leaped as she looked at a pair
of bright pink vases, trimmed with an excellent
imitation of sugar icing, seeing them already
as her very own.</p>

<p>“Photo-frames and such-like won’t pay for
the taking, either,” Mattie was saying hesitatingly,
“though wild horses ’emselves wouldn’t
make me part with the photos. I’ve a regular
stack of ’em as They’ve sent me, year in and
year out, especially of the children. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
folks’d say it was nonsense taking photos along
when you’re going to see the folks themselves,
but I’ve grown that used to them I’ve got to
have them.”</p>

<p>She remembered now that she had not yet
spent the hour with the grandchildren which she
had promised herself earlier, and proceeded to
take it, setting them forth to Dolly with that
sense of proud showmanship which the first
generation almost invariably seems to feel
towards the third. It was impossible to believe,
listening to her vivid description of its looks
and ways, that she had never yet set eyes upon
a single member of it. Smiling and happy,
she had found for herself again that first ecstasy
which she had felt upon awakening from her
dream. Canada was again what she had thought
it to be, as she laughed and talked, wearing
always that inward look of those who ponder
upon hidden treasure.</p>

<p>“Luke’s youngest, they say, is as like me as
a couple of peas, and Joe’s second takes after
Kirkby. He’s a bit darker, perhaps, and he’s
brown eyes instead of blue, but there’s no mistaking
where he comes from, either in looks or
manners. Little Eric, they call him, after his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
mother’s father, though I don’t know why they
need go out of the family when there’s so many
good names shouting. I’m right set upon little
Eric.... Maggie’s May frames something
grand at the piano, and Ellen’s Sally shapes to
have a voice.... Luke’s eldest’s getting on
for twelve, and can manage a motor-mower
... leastways, they say he can, though I
doubt they’re putting it on.”</p>

<p>“Jessie can’t abide Canadian children,”
Dolly cut in, introducing that unpleasant
person for the first time into the parlour.
“Real nasty about ’em, she is. She couldn’t
abide English children, either, if it comes to
that, judging from what parents and such-like
used to say about her when she taught school.
But Canadian children, she says, are that
uppish and wild there’s no doing anything with
them. Like savages, you’d think they were,
if you swallowed everything you heard from
Jessie. Fine children to look at, she says, and
healthy and all that; but that noisy and full
of beans they fair make an English person
tired.”</p>

<p>Mattie had a horrid vision of a narrow
and crowded house, with Kirkby and herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
hemmed in by leaping, shouting children.
She herself had once rather rejoiced in noise,
though Kirkby had always hated it; but she
was not so sure now that, after all these years
of silence, she would not hate it, too. Luke
had two other boys besides young Joe of the
motor-mower, as well as a little girl just over
a year old. He was fond of company, too, and
was never so happy as when extending hospitality.
Also he had that piano, she remembered
with dismay, upon which both relatives and
friends came eagerly to practise....</p>

<p>The homes of the younger children had
nothing better to offer, for they, too, had
growing families, and in even smaller houses.
It was true that she and Kirkby would have
their own home before so long, but she could
not think of it now with her early happy passion.
It seemed vulnerable to her now, and no longer
a haven of contentment. For the first time in
her life she saw the good stone walls of her
English cottage as a frame for privacy and
peace.</p>

<p>“Jessie says Canadian children <i>aren’t</i> children
as we know ’em,” Dolly was saying blandly.
“She says they grow up that fast it’s hard to remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
they’ve ever even been babies. They’re
grown folks, she says, before you can hardly
turn round, same as that fine lad of Luke’s you
said could manage a motor. I reckon you’ll
be surprised, Mrs. Kirkby, by the time you
get there, to find how they’ve all come on.”</p>

<p>Mattie turned to the door with the same sharp
movement with which she had endeavoured
to rid herself of Jessie in the kitchen. That
last stroke of hers, dealt through Dolly’s
innocent tongue, had gone a great deal nearer
home than she cared to realise. Like most
grandmothers, she had thought of the children
as children only, hardly believing that in the
future they would be grown-up people. And
especially she had thought of little Eric as
remaining always little Eric.... Yet already,
as she remembered, a year had passed since
they had sent her his last picture. By the time
she got out to him, she reflected grimly, he,
too, might have risen to the dignity of the
motor-mower!</p>

<p>“Time we were having tea,” she said firmly,
waving Dolly before her through the door.
“You’ll be wanting it, I’m sure. As for me,
I’m that worn out with all that shoving and siding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
I could do with a dozen teas instead of
one!”</p>

<p>Back in the kitchen, however, she was diverted
by still another matter, which kept the tea
waiting a little longer. Going to a cupboard
in the wall, she opened the door and stood
looking at its contents.</p>

<p>“I can’t make up my mind what to do about
my jam,” she said, as Dolly joined her. “It
fair goes to my heart to leave it. Yet it seems
silly, doesn’t it, to go hugging jam-pots and
such-like across the ocean? I doubt it’ll
have to be put in the sale.”</p>

<p>“Folks’ll be fighting like cats for it, if it is!”
Dolly laughed, peering admiringly round her
shoulder. Even at this time of the year the
shelves were still half-filled with rows of glistening
jars, making, with their white caps topping
their coloured bodies, a smart and polished
regiment. “It’s a long while back since I
first heard tell there was nothing to beat your
jam.”</p>

<p>Mattie looked pleased, and her voice lost
the rather dull tone which had suddenly come
into it since her late depression in the parlour.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve always prided myself on getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
it just so,” she said, eyeing the glories of the
cupboard proudly. “It’s been my hobby, as
you might say. Getting the best of everything,
that’s the secret,—the best fruit and the best
sugar, and making sure of the boiling. Not
but what like enough there’s a knack to it as
well, same as there is for making butter and
setting hens.”</p>

<p>She ran her hand fondly over the white
paper carpet above which the jams glowed like
so many jewels, the raspberries looking like
pressed garnets against the prison of their glass,
and the red currant and apple jellies gleaming
like ruby and yellow topaz.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty to go at yet, as you can see,
even though we’re well past the turn of the
year. I always make a fairish amount, in case
we get a bad year after a good one. ’Tisn’t as
if my jam wouldn’t keep; in a good season,
I reckon, it’d keep till the Day of Judgment!...
This shelf’s near all rasps, and that’s
apricot and a bit of marrow. There’s some
blackberry jelly behind, and a taste of wineberry.
We haven’t a deal of gooseberry and
rhubarb, but there’s a lot of plum. That pot
or two of black currant is just for when Kirkby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
gets a cough; and here’s where I keep my
Best Strawberry.”</p>

<p>The red had come into Dolly’s face as she
looked, gloating over the housewife’s riches
with honest pleasure. Catching her breath
a little as Mattie stopped, she broke into quick
speech.</p>

<p>“Likely you’ll know, Mrs. Kirkby, what we’re
hoping’ll come to Len? Mr. Kirkby was right
kind when he spoke about it, this morning.
It’s early days to be talking, perhaps, but I
thought you wouldn’t mind....”</p>

<p>Mattie took her hand away from the shining
pot which she was stroking as a man strokes the
glossy coat of a horse, and looked round slowly.
“Talking about what?” she enquired, looking
at the colour in Dolly’s face, and then away
again.</p>

<p>“About Len applying for head place, if
Mr. Kirkby gives up,” Dolly said, growing
more and more nervous with every second.
“I shouldn’t have said anything, perhaps, but
I thought you’d be sure to know.”</p>

<p>For quite a long time Mattie was silent from
sheer surprise, not so much at Dolly’s announcement
as at her own reception of it. No more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
than to Kirkby had it occurred to her to speculate
as to his probable successor, but if ever she
had arrived at speculation, she would have been
certain that it would not trouble her. Yet
here she was filled with anger and scorn, not
only on Kirkby’s account, but actually on her
own! Len’s reaching out for the gardens
which she had always hated should have been
nothing to her, by rights; yet the very suggestion
had set her seething with injured pride
and pain.</p>

<p>“Nay, I’ve heard nothing about it, not I,”
she managed to get out presently, trying to
keep out of her voice her conviction that Len
was an impudent monkey and a robber. “But
he’ll be as likely as anybody, I should say, if
it comes to choosing.”</p>

<p>Dolly’s face glowed at this grudging praise,
and she went forward with fresh confidence.</p>

<p>“That’s right good of you, Mrs. Kirkby,
seeing it’s your own business we’re after.
I shouldn’t have mentioned it but for the jam.
But I’d be glad, if you’re selling, to take some
of it over before the sale——”</p>

<p>She stopped as Mattie put out her arms again
towards the shelves in a gesture which she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
not interpret, but which was, as a matter of
fact, a gesture of protection. Now it was
Dolly as well as Len who seemed a thief,
stretching out greedy hands to her own most
precious belongings. She saw her moving
about her home, sitting in her chairs, walking
in the cool of the evening in her sacred garden.
Her heart rose against her in a rage of distress
which almost threatened to choke her. At
that moment she could have driven the other
woman from the house with blows....</p>

<p>With agitated movements she began to push
the jars as far back on their shelves as they
would go, thrusting them out of sight and
danger like a hen protecting her chickens.
She closed the door with a bang, and snapped
the lock with a click; and then, normal again
with the shutting away of the threatened
treasure, turned to Dolly, smiling.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, we’ll talk about that later, when
we’ve got things settled. Now I’m wanting
my tea. Fill kettle and boil it, will you, while
I set the cloth?... We’re taking this over
seriously,” she added, with a laugh, “and
forgetting it’s just pretence!”</p>

<p>Dolly laughed, too, not only in polite recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
of the assumption with which they had
started out, but because she felt relieved. There
had been a strong feeling of tension in the air
as they stood before the cupboard, and she was
glad to get away from it. For the first time it
crossed her kindly, unthinking little mind that
things might have been better conducted, that
afternoon....</p>

<p>But she was soon at her ease again when they
were seated at their meal, pleasantly conscious,
as they kept telling each other, laughing, how
well they had earned it. Her confidence
returned, which had so nearly been shattered
by the episode of the jam, and she let herself
babble freely. Mattie found herself listening
with interest to local gossip, and giving fervent
attention to the local scandals. Hitherto she
had never cared a rap what happened in the
hamlet, and could only conclude that this was
one of the many changes which had come upon
her to-day.</p>

<p>She had sworn to herself that she would not
mention Canada again, but before they were
half-way through the meal she had broken her
intention. By the time she had poured the
second cups of tea she was gone abroad, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
an interested Dolly with her. Seated at a
cottage tea-table, they were yet gold-seekers
and explorers, game-hunters in the Rockies,
and adventurers shooting the rapids. Their
lungs were braced by the air of the Strong
Country, and its distances lightened their eyes.
The wind that blows over the prairies filled
and freshened the little room.</p>

<p>“I’d a dream about it, last night,” Mattie
said presently, reverting to that solemn and
lovely subject a little shyly. “I was There,
just as I’m here now, and with none of that
nasty crossing. I saw the places and the folks
and the insides of the houses.... And everything
was as nice as could be, in spite of your
cousin Jessie!”</p>

<p>With her own lips she had invoked the demon
of the situation, and instantly it was at grips
with her. Dolly, dashed by the sense of insecurity
which had alarmed her before tea,
had kept a guard on her tongue as soon as
Canada was mentioned. But now Mattie, of
her own accord, had raised that guard, and she
rushed in briskly.</p>

<p>“Jessie wouldn’t know a nice spot if it up
and told her about it,” she said gaily. “She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
was always a wet blanket.... But they’ll get
the surprise of their lives when they hear you’re
coming, Mrs. Kirkby. Jessie says they’ve all
of ’em given up hopes of it long ago.”</p>

<p>A sudden quiet seemed to fall and envelop
Mattie, a quiet which spread and spread and
travelled over the kitchen. After a long moment—“Who
told her they’d given up hope?”
she enquired, stilly.</p>

<p>“Ellen told her herself,” Mrs. Machell
replied, uneasily conscious that the tension
was returning. “‘Father’ll be getting past it,
is what she says, and I reckon so will Mother.’
She’s a grand plan now for coming over to
you instead. She’s just breaking her heart,
Jessie says, to get back again over here....
She talks of bringing little Sally with her
when she comes, and leaving her if you
want her. She’ll be a help to you, she says,
now you’re beginning to get on; and Sally’s
as keen as mustard to come and live with
Granny.”</p>

<p>She stopped then, startled by the loudness of
her voice in the growing stillness, which seemed
at the same time both to accentuate it and rebuke
it. Looking across at her hostess, she felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
almost panic-stricken at the change which had
come upon her. It was impossible, she said
to herself, that those few chattered words should
so greatly have disturbed her. As if it mattered
what Jessie said, or what she chose to repeat!
Yet Mattie was sunk in her chair as if the
vigour which usually sustained her had suddenly
departed from her. Exhaustion had drained
the blood from her face, and without its customary
bright colour it looked somehow smaller.
And wrapping her round about was that curious
curtain of quiet; a shroud, as it were, automatically
produced for something that had
ceased to be....</p>

<p>Glancing at the clock, Dolly stood up sharply,
setting the china ringing.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to be going, Mrs. Kirkby,” she
said as quietly as she could, yet shrinking again
from her voice as it smote upon the silence.
“Len’ll be wanting his tea. I’ll just have time
to lend you a hand with the washing-up, and
then I must be off.”</p>

<p>She had still another moment of panic before
Mattie stirred, afterwards getting to her feet
in a series of rather helpless movements.
Dolly watched her with troubled eyes, wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
always how far she was responsible for the
sudden situation. Even now that Mattie was
standing up and moving about, she felt ill at
ease with her. The absurd thought flashed
through her mind that the Mrs. Kirkby who
had got up was not the same Mrs. Kirkby who
had sat down!...</p>

<p>Between them, they got the washing-up put
through in record time, which yet seemed
unnaturally long because of the heavy silence
in which they did it. Mattie’s work was as
efficient as ever, but it seemed to have lost its
spring. Her hands, moving with dull sureness
among the cups and saucers, looked strangely
old and weak. Dolly was dull, too, her brain
groping its way back over the talk of the
afternoon, and anathematising both her own
foolishness and the grumblings of Cousin
Jessie. It was with a sense of acute relief
that at last she put on her hat and hurried to
the door.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be saying good day to you, Mrs.
Kirkby,” she announced hastily to the still
only half-recognisable figure of Mattie which
had followed her. “It’s been real pleasant to
have a chat. If you want a bit of help again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
when it really comes to packing, you’ve only
to let me know.”</p>

<p>Mattie spoke to her then, though in an altered
tone which corresponded with her altered
presence. With an obvious effort she made
her little speech of thanks,—Dolly moving
restlessly the while,—and then bade her wait
a moment. Going back into the kitchen, she
reappeared with a pot of her Best Strawberry.</p>

<p>“Nay, I want you to take it,” she insisted,
firmly if dully, as Mrs. Machell protested.
“You’ve been right kind. I’ll give you them
pink vases, if you’ll have ’em, before the sale,
but anyhow I’d like you to have a taste of my
good strawberry.”</p>

<p>The tears came into Dolly’s eyes. Regardless
of the jam-pot, she put her arms round Mattie’s
neck and hugged her.</p>

<p>“I don’t need presents just for enjoying
myself!” she said, laughing and crying together.
“Eh, Mrs. Kirkby, but I’d be right
glad if I heard as you weren’t going!”</p>

<p>She was gone herself then, running across
the gardens, jam-pot in hand, and Mattie
waited until she had lost sight of her. Her lips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
had quivered a little at the warm pressure of
Dolly’s cheek, but they did not quiver now.
Her figure straightened itself slightly as she
turned on her heel, and went back slowly,
but with set purpose, into the darkening
house.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE went back into the kitchen and sat
down at the table from which the tea-things
had been removed, and which now wore
its evening glory of crimson cloth. The sight
of the cloth reminded her that Kirkby had not
yet come in for his meal, and she wondered
what had become of him. But she forgot him
again in the urge for settlement with herself
which had suddenly seized her. Sinking herself
in the problems which beset her, she lost
all consciousness of time and place.</p>

<p>She sat heavily in her chair, with the heaviness
of exhaustion, but with less of that air of
lowered vitality which had frightened Mrs.
Machell. A little force had returned to her
joined hands, laid loosely along the table. Her
face, lifted and looking straight before her, was
the face of one who at the same time sits in
judgment and awaits the decision of some
tribunal.</p>

<p>She was still numb from the shock of Dolly’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
communication, but she was bracing herself
all the time. She was trying to make herself
understand that she had still to decide about
Canada, still to set the balance dipping one way
or the other. She had thought the choice made
long since, clinched long ago beyond all possible
change. But the truth was that you could
neither test nor be tested by a situation which
had not as yet arisen. She saw now that the
decision had never really been made at all;
that it never could have been made until
Kirkby had written the letter....</p>

<p>She had forgotten, too, that, while she waited,
time had been at work, busily adding its make-weights
on this side or on that. She had forgotten
that people alter ... that places alter
... that she herself, even in the iron mould
of her obsession, might possibly alter....
Behind her set face she was filled with fear
that some still-unnoticed change might tip the
scale against her.</p>

<p>So many ages seemed to have fled since the
joy of the morning that she peered back at it
with dim eyes as at some memory of childhood.
Yet the steps by which she had come to this pass
had been so swift that her brain swam at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
mere remembrance. But they had only seemed
swift because of the suddenness with which
revelation after revelation had been sprung
upon her. The truths lying behind those
changes of thought and scene must have been
growing in secret for many a long year.</p>

<p>It was not only the whinings of Cousin Jessie
which had taken her courage from her, stealing
it, hour by hour, as if it was her very life-blood
that they drained. The dream itself had undermined
it, puzzling and depressing her even
while it glorified and exalted. She remembered
the Questions, and shrank from the finger of
warning which they so obviously had pointed.
And she remembered that Ellen ... but she
was still too bruised and shocked to dare to dwell
upon Ellen.</p>

<p>And after the dream there had been other
portents and signs, each of them, as it were,
putting out an unseen arm in order to stay her.
All day long she had been called to attention
by the things about her, as well as by the sudden,
unwished-for rising of old memories. Both
within and without, as it were, she had been
attacked, and before each attack had retreated
a step further. All day long it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
brought home to her that she was exchanging
the substance for the shadow, and that, in
her insistence upon Canada, she was cutting
herself off from the things which really
mattered.</p>

<p>She said to herself angrily, as if accusing some
outside power, that she had not known that
places and houses could hold you against your
will. She had tried to keep herself free, like
a soldier awaiting his orders, and she had never
once been free. Not only that, but it was she
herself who had been forced to betray herself.
Even while she was nursing and keeping warm
her hatred of her surroundings, her heart
was beginning to love them. Even while
she had imagined herself to be facing steadily
forward, she was already beginning to look
back.</p>

<p>Dick Nelson had been right in saying that,
no matter how you might fight against it, you
were bound to settle, in the end. She had been
angry about it, at the time, angry and contemptuous,
but she saw what he meant now. The
gardens had grown no wider for her as time
went on, but they had grown deeper. She had
taken root.... It seemed as if the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
where you had suffered held you as surely in
the end as the place where you had been content....</p>

<p>And in the same way people got hold of you,
after a while ... even those you disliked, let
alone people like Mrs. Grisedale and Mrs.
Ellwood. In spite of yourself they became part
of your life,—that life which you had not
wanted, perhaps, which had either been thrust
upon you, or which you had chosen by mistake,
but which nevertheless you had steadily gone
on living. You could not keep yourself away
from people, no matter how you tried. Even
if you shared nothing else with them, you
shared the same countryside. Your life was
marked by the milestones of their happenings,
just as their lives were marked by yours.
And when the time came to die, you lay down
together to sleep in the same soil....</p>

<p>She was too old for Canada, she said to herself,
accepting the fact calmly because as yet
it had not come home to her. Not too old in
body, perhaps, in spite of her age, but almost
certainly in spirit. You could not fret and
fight, year after year, as she had fretted and
fought, without something wearing out in you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
And even her body felt too old to-night for
the land of which she had always thought as
a place of vivid youth. She would feel better
in the morning, of course,—better and more
equal to things,—because you always did feel
better in the morning. It was one of the
lessons of life that you could face things in the
morning which you could not face at night.
But always the night came again.... In any
case, something told her that to-day she had
touched what was for her the highest point
of living. After to-day she would begin
definitely to grow old.</p>

<p>Safety was what you needed most when you
were beginning to get on; not to be high
adventurers and pioneers. Pioneers and adventurers
weren’t safe,—couldn’t be, in the
nature of things. Whatever happened, she
and Kirkby would have certain dangers to face,
even though they were not going actually into
the wilds. Dangers from people and food,
from climate and travel and strain.... There
were dangers everywhere, of course,—even
here; but long custom had taught them how
to avoid them. You got used to most of your
dangers, except for those unforeseen; and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
you were used to your dangers they were no
longer very dangerous.</p>

<p>Safety and peace and quiet, and a certain
amount of ease; not hen-hulls and yelling
children, such as Cousin Jessie had pictured.
Jessie, of course, had been drawing the long
bow, even if she had not been telling absolute
untruths. But it would be different from
England, nevertheless. Whatever Luke’s home
might be like, it would not have the settled
dignity of the home in which he had been
reared. As for their own, which had yet to be
built, it would have even less than Luke’s.
It would have no dignity because it would have
no memories and no past. It would be empty,
and they would not have time to fill it. They
would barely have grown used to it, and it to
them, before death, with a crooked finger,
would beckon them both out.</p>

<p>It was too late, she said to herself again, and
felt through her calm the upstriking pang which
the words inevitably evoke. It was true, as
Dick said, that you could wait too long, so that,
when the time came, and the chance offered,
you were not able to take it. And the reason
you were not able was because you had nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
left with which to meet it. The strength
which you needed for new conditions had been
squandered long ago, frittered away, day by
day, in striving and rebellion.</p>

<p>The children thought it too late, too....
Her heart contracted as she remembered that,
and she drew in her breath sharply. They had
ceased to look for her long since,—if it was true
what Jessie had told Dolly. It seemed a betrayal
beyond pardon that they should not have gone
on hoping as long as they could; at all events
until she, who had lived on that hope, had
finally resigned it. But she had never hinted
at such a thing, not even in the latest of her
letters. Perhaps they had laughed at the
letters, she thought, shrinking; had mocked,
even if ever so kindly, at the old mother who
would not own herself defeated....</p>

<p>At least they had not mocked her when they
wrote, nor had they ever implied that they
had ceased to expect her. They had kept it
up, just as she had kept it up, and with all the
old happy anticipation. And for long enough
now it had been just pretence ... that is,
if you could believe Jessie. She felt suddenly
that she hated letters and the things that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
could do.... Jessie’s letters, which had brought
about this present trouble ... the letters
from the children, without which she might
possibly have settled down long since....</p>

<p>She came at last to the thought of Ellen, and
forced herself to meet it. It was Ellen who had
hurt her most,—Ellen, who had been nearest
to her, and had always understood her. Not
only had she ceased to believe that she would
come, but, with the plan for her own visit
growing in her mind, she must also have ceased
to hope for it. She had told a complete stranger
that she was breaking her heart, longingly
looking back to the home she had left so gladly.
She had not told her mother that she was
breaking her heart.... Mattie felt the desolation
of one who, dedicated to some cause,
finds that the comrade with whom he has
travelled has secretly turned back.</p>

<p>She remembered Ellen’s packet now, and,
getting up to look for it, returned with it
resolutely to the table. She opened it slowly,
fumbling with paper and string, and without
any interest in what she was doing. Her
mind, persistently turned inward upon its
sorrow, refused to focus for more than a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
upon any external object. All that she could
think of at the moment was the hard fact of
Ellen’s backsliding, and the breaking of the
bond which had so long existed between them.</p>

<p>There was a photograph in the packet, as she
had thought, and presently she had unwrapped
it and had it lying before her. There was no
accompanying letter that she could find; but
there was nothing in that, as she had had one
only yesterday. Taking the picture in her hands,
she made a determined effort to fix her attention
upon it.</p>

<p>After that first glance at it, however, she made
as if to throw it down, for the woman in it was
not Ellen. This was a middle-aged stranger,
with traces of hard work in her face and hands,
a little droop to her head and a slight stoop to
her shoulders. The lips smiled, it was true,
but behind the attempt at gaiety the face was
tired. Even the clothes she wore had something
a little strange about them to Mattie’s English
eyes.</p>

<p>Yet for all that it was still Ellen.... Even
as she looked she saw the likeness stand out,
first, in the curve of the cheek, and then in
the curve of the mouth. They were Ellen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
eyes, when she came to study them, though
the laughing and dancing in them had sunk
deeper. They were Ellen’s hands, too, which,
even to this day, had kept their old childish
habit of clutching at her gown.</p>

<p>Her heart swelled as she looked, both on her
own account and on her daughter’s, thinking
of the light, laughing thing that had gone out
of the cottage, to return to her in this guise.
She had known that she would look older, of
course, and, as far as she could, had taught
herself to expect it. But she could never have
believed that the years would make so much
difference. She remembered that Ellen was
younger than Dolly,—Dolly, with her plump,
straight, little figure and cheerful, unlined face,-and
felt the tears that were in her heart rise
up and fill her throat.</p>

<p>A horror of Canada seized her,—horror and
fear of the land which had played such havoc
with Ellen, and which had taken her away from
her in more senses than she knew. For it was
neither the added years nor the look of endurance
which troubled her, after the first. People
grew older in England, as well as anywhere
else, and Ellen had never been very strong....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
What frightened her was the unmistakable air
of another country, turning her daughter into
a stranger.</p>

<p>She sat for a long time trying to will the young
Ellen back into the picture, and saw the youth
come into it by degrees as the spring green
comes upon the hedgerows. And presently,
when she had her again, the longing to see her
grew greater than she could bear. Silently
and unknown to her, as she stared, the tears
ran down her face....</p>

<p>She must see her, at all costs, she said to
herself, in spite of Ellen’s lack of confidence
and the bitterness of betrayal. It would be
harder to go now, both because of her own
clearer vision of things, and because of the
fading impulse from Over There which had
done so much to sustain her. The glamour
had gone out of the enterprise for ever. But
she could not afford to wait until Ellen should
find both money and opportunity for her visit.
At all costs, she must go to Canada.</p>

<p>But even as she made her decision she
remembered the sea, and shrank from it in her
mind as if from an actual presence. It had
frightened her even in her morning freshness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
in her evening weariness it became a stalking
horror. Her passion for size and space, together
with her power of visualisation, turned
upon her now to her own undoing. The
Atlantic rose up against her in its sullen depth
and strength, in chain upon chain of endless,
rolling mountains. Presently, as it seemed, the
advancing terror was in the garden and in the
house, and under the waves of her huge vision
she saw herself sink and drown....</p>

<p>She came back at last to find herself twisted
in her chair, with her eyes fixed upon some
half-seen but definitely soothing object. As
her mind cleared she found that she was looking
through the open larder door, and out through
the window beyond which vignetted the privet
hedge. She could see the lawn, too, shadowy
and mysterious with the evening, and the rosebush,
slimmed and thinned to almost elfin
proportions. Over the hedge-top there still
lingered a segment of silvered, tranquil sky....</p>

<p>Her heart stopped pounding as she looked,
and the choking terror which had sprung on
her out of the ocean slowly loosed its grip. The
peace of the garden reached her even in the
house, making an exquisite stillness where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the sea had roared and rolled. She sat drinking
in the quiet, watching the sky fade and the
lawn dim as veil after veil was laid upon them....
And then again she remembered Ellen.</p>

<p>She would never be able to get to Ellen if
she could not face the sea, and she knew now
that she could not face it. There was no
deliverance, after all. All that she could do was
to sit and wait for Ellen to come, and Ellen
might never come.... She sprang to her
feet, crying aloud that she was trapped, as
Kirkby, down in the garden, was crying that
he was trapped. She could neither go nor
stay, she said to herself, get to Ellen nor remain
here. Life, after all these years of bitterness
and despair, could do nothing better for her
than to get her into this trap....</p>

<p>With the supreme terror upon her of those
who see themselves caught by life she ran to the
door, and beheld the bowed figure of Kirkby,
dusky and ghost-like in the distance. Leaving
the house, as if it was her own self that she left,
she went running and stumbling towards him
across the gardens.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">HE came hurriedly to meet her, forgetting
himself and his personal misery in this
sudden alarm. “What’s to do, Mattie? What’s
wrong?” he enquired anxiously, as they drew
near to each other in the shadows.</p>

<p>She stumbled the last few yards, and clung
to his arm. He could feel her shaking. Even
in the dusk he could see the marks of tears
upon her face.</p>

<p>“What’s to do?” he said again.</p>

<p>She made an effort to control herself then,
and heard her voice come out as if from some
other person.</p>

<p>“We can’t go,” she said, and her voice
broke. “It’s no use! We can’t go.”</p>

<p>He felt, as it were, a sudden lightening of
the atmosphere about them; as if the sun,
already gone some time, had for the moment
broken out afresh.... But he was too tired
to feel more; too tired, certainly, to feel glad.
Indeed, he was conscious, rather, of a faint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
resentment that the problem which had cost
so much to settle should be about to be reopened.</p>

<p>“Best come into the house, hadn’t you?”
he said, evading it for the moment, and gently
urging her back again in the direction from which
she had come. “It’s getting damp out here.”</p>

<p>She nodded her head with a docility which
sat strangely upon her, and, still holding to
his arm, allowed him to lead her back. She
said nothing more as they went, only catching
at her breath from time to time with little
signals of distress which awoke in him a succession
of answering quivers. The gardens
saw them enter the house together, and disappear
into the further gloom of the kitchen.</p>

<p>The sight of the red tablecloth aroused her
temporarily, as it had done before. “Eh, now!
You’ve never had your tea,” she sighed, shocked
out of her preoccupation by that great forgetfulness.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a bite of something presently,”
Kirkby said, taking off his hat with the limp
gesture of a man whose weariness had long since
passed the stage of desire for food and drink.
“It’s you I’m bothered about. What’s been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
to do you’ve gone and got yourself in such
a state?”</p>

<p>She dropped back into the seat from which she
had raised herself in order to go to him, and
sank her head on her hand.</p>

<p>“It’s just that,” she said. “We can’t go....
I’ve seen it coming on like all day, and now
it’s come to bide.”</p>

<p>He eyed her thoughtfully, not daring to take
what she said literally,—scarcely, indeed, wishing
at that moment to take it literally....
“You’re over-tired, that’s what it is,” he said,
at last. “You haven’t hurt yourself, have you,
pulling that furniture about?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’ve taken no harm.”</p>

<p>“Likely you haven’t thought on to get your
own tea, neither?” he enquired.</p>

<p>“Ay, but I have,—and a rare good tea an’
all!” She winced at the remembrance, recalling
the happy half-hour which she and Dolly
had spent before Cousin Jessie had struck
her to the heart.... “But we can’t go.”</p>

<p>He stood hesitating in front of her, his mind
wholly occupied by the need to get her comforted.
She was tired, he said to himself, and
folks didn’t always mean what they said when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
they were tired. His heart ached as he looked
at her, remembering as he did the fine joyfulness
of spirit with which she had parted from him
at noon.</p>

<p>“You’d best tell me about it, hadn’t you,
Mattie?” he ventured presently. “You’d
feel a deal better if you could tell somebody.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to tell....” She avoided
his eyes, feeling the colour rise in her cheek.
She was ashamed that even Kirkby should see
her in this moment of defeat. “Nothing much,
I mean,” she went on, in a dull tone, “and what
there is you’d likely not understand.”</p>

<p>“I could try, anyway, Mattie.”</p>

<p>She gave a deep sigh and put her hands before
her face. He waited patiently, standing with
that still poise of his in which he seemed to
breathe as quietly as a flower. And almost at
once she began to speak, jerkily at first, but
gradually gathering smoothness and speed,
and keeping her hands always on either side
of her face as if they guarded her.</p>

<p>“It’s just we’ve waited too long.... Things
alter if you wait. You stop wanting things
you’ve always wanted, and you get to like
things you used to hate. And you get old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
waiting. I didn’t know till to-day I was getting
old.”</p>

<p>“You’re not old, Mattie.”</p>

<p>“I’m old inside,—old in my heart. Folks
as keep their hearts up never get old, but I’ve
not kept mine. If I could have kept my heart
up I’d have been young, even at a hundred,
but I’ve not kept it up. I’ve been letting go
all the time, though I didn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“How d’you mean—letting go?”</p>

<p>“Giving up about going to Canada,—that’s
what I’m trying to say. I’ve been thinking all
these years I’d be mad to go when the time
came. I thought I’d be that glad I wouldn’t
mind what I found Over There or what I’d
to leave behind. And it isn’t like that at all.
Now it’s really come to it, I’m—afraid.”</p>

<p>“How d’you mean—afraid?”</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh that was more dreary
than any sob,—the laugh of the naturally brave
person who for the first time in life comes under
the domination of fear.</p>

<p>“Afraid of near everything, it seems to me!...
Afraid I’ll get hankering after things,
this side, when it’s too late to come back.
Afraid of breaking my heart Over There, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
I’ve broken it over here.... Afraid of all
the new folks and new sights. Afraid of the
sea——”</p>

<p>She shuddered as she said the last word,
seeing, even as she spoke, the first wave of her
vision come rolling back upon her. Kirkby
looked surprised.</p>

<p>“What’s put that into your head?” he asked,
puzzled. “You’ve never let on before you
minded the sea?”</p>

<p>“I’ve always minded it,” Mattie said. “First
time I set eyes on it,—ay, and long before that.
But I wouldn’t let on about it even to myself.
I made out it wouldn’t matter, just as I made out
other things wouldn’t matter. But I was only
cheating myself all the time. They <i>do</i> matter,
and I do mind; and now I’m old I haven’t the
courage to face ’em.”</p>

<p>“You’ll face ’em right enough to-morrow,—see
if you won’t! You’re over-tired to-night.
I’ll be bound you weren’t bothering about the
sea when you woke this morning!”</p>

<p>He spoke purposely in a light, bantering
tone, hoping to stir her out of her trouble;
but she shook her head.</p>

<p>“There’ll be another night to-morrow....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
It’s the nights you’ve got to think of, when
you’re getting old. And it isn’t only the sea.
There’s other things as well.”</p>

<p>“Tell me the other things, Mattie.”</p>

<p>She shook her head again, but almost at
once she was launched upon her tale, as if the
little movement had flung her into the tideway.
As well as she could she described to him her
reactions during the day, beginning with the
little cloud which had shadowed even the
dream itself, and which had grown to such
proportions by the evening. Her talk halted
and turned upon itself and wandered to and
fro, until not only the tale but the hours themselves
seemed twisted into a tangle. Something,
however, of the actual state of things emerged
finally from the muddle, together with a fairly
definite indication of how it had come about.</p>

<p>She told him, still shielded by her hands,
how the house and the garden had caught at her
unawares, rising up against her with armed
memories which she had not known to possess
the power to wound her. She told him of
Dick’s grumbled warnings, of her passion for
the privet hedge, of the jealousy and injured
pride with which she had found herself facing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
Mrs. Machell. She told him at great length of
the underminings of Cousin Jessie. And at
the last, sighing and half-sobbing, she told him
of the betrayal of the children, and the greater
treachery of Ellen.</p>

<p>“That’s what’s getting at me most,” she
finished, hating her own voice as she heard it
quiver. “That’s what’s done me down.
T’other things was bad enough, of course,
fretting me right and left till I was near frantic.
But I’d have got over ’em, likely, after a bit,
and when I was feeling better. Likely I would,
that is. I’m not so sure.... But what beats me
is the children going back on us and thinking
we wouldn’t come. Folks as stop believing in
a thing like as not stop wanting it,—that’s how
it seems to me.”</p>

<p>Kirkby had stood silent during the first part
of the recital, and had seated himself silently
when he found it promised to be a long one.
Once, later, he got up to look for the lamp,
only to find that Mattie had forgotten to fill it.
This oversight on the part of one usually so
methodical and efficient told him more than
even the hurried and broken talk with which
she was assailing him. Lighting a candle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
which he discovered on the mantelpiece, he
sat down again, setting the light between
them.</p>

<p>He was not thinking much as he listened;
only allowing her to pour her story into his
mind, so that, when the time came, and she was
silent again, he might find the right words
with which to cheer her. Still less was he
feeling.... He had already exhausted his
own powers of emotion, first, in that journey
into the past which he had taken, across the
river, and then in his final revolt and recession
in the garden. He felt utterly detached from
the situation which was riving Mattie in twain
as if it was with an actual devil that she strove.
Whether they went or stayed made no difference
to him at the moment. He had passed, for the
time being, to a plane where the things of this
world could no longer affect him, either for
good or evil.</p>

<p>“It’s Ellen bothers me most,” Mattie was
saying, the quiver in her voice becoming more
and more pronounced. “I’d have thought
Ellen would have looked for me till I was in my
coffin,—ay, and after that! Jessie says she
talks nowadays of coming here instead, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
doubt she never will. Likely she’ll wait and
wait and never come, same as I’ve waited and
waited and never gone.... And if she puts it
off a deal longer I won’t answer for it we’ll
know her. That’s her photo she’s sent, over
there, and for more than a while I made sure
it was somebody else.”</p>

<p>Kirkby turned his eyes towards the photograph
on the table, and turned them away again.
He had no desire to look at it just then, or to
test the truth of what Mattie was saying. His
power to interest himself in such things would
return to-morrow, when he would welcome
even a doubtful presentment of his absent
daughter. But to-night he had passed beyond
his children, and felt no bond with them. They
were no more to him at the moment than the
transplanted sapling is to the parent stem from
which it was once grown.</p>

<p>“You’re taking a deal for granted, it seems
to me,” he said, at last. “You’ve only Len’s
wife’s word for it about Ellen and the rest,
and not at first hand, neither. Yon cousin of
hers needs taking with a deal of salt.”</p>

<p>Mattie nodded drearily.</p>

<p>“You’re right, there! She’s one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
do-nowts as has always a sight to complain of,
wherever they are.... But I feel it’s true,
all the same. It’s only natural folks should
give up looking for you when you’ve been so
long on the road.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it matters whether they’ve given
up or not. They’d be just as glad to see you,
once you’d got across.”</p>

<p>“It <i>would</i> matter,” Mattie said. “Something’d
have gone ... broken ... nay, I
can’t explain!” She stopped, hunting vainly
for words with which to convey to him that
the motive power would be crippled, the circuit
hopelessly snapped.... “But it wouldn’t be
the same.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her with his clear, faded eyes,
wondering to himself how far it was wise to
attempt to argue with her.</p>

<p>“You’ll not take kindly to stopping, Mattie,”
he said presently, tentatively but bravely.
“You’ve got to remember that.”</p>

<p>“I’m not likely to forget it.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t as if you wouldn’t feel different in
the morning, you know. You’re tired, to-night.
You’ll get hankering again, I doubt, as soon as
you’re rested.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“I doubt I will.”</p>

<p>“Folks don’t change that easy,” Kirkby
persisted. “You’ve been set on Canada so
long, you’ll find it hard to put away from you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to try.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be letters coming an’ all——” he
continued firmly, and she put out her hand,
crying, “Nay, now! Don’t, don’t!” but he
steeled himself against her. However it hurt,
they had both of them got to be sure that she
knew what she was doing.</p>

<p>“And there’s the grandchildren, you’ll think
on; you’ve not forgotten them? You’ll likely
never set eyes on them if you don’t go. It
costs a deal to go back and forwards, these days,
and there’s time as well. Sally’ll likely come,
if Ellen’s bringing her to stop, but not Joe’s
lad or the rest——”</p>

<p>She stumbled to her feet, throwing out her
hand a second time as if to lay it across his
patient, relentless mouth.</p>

<p>“Nay, now! <i>Don’t</i>, I tell you! D’you
think I don’t know what it’ll be like, and how
it’s going to hurt before I’ve finished with it?
Day and night I’ll remember,—day and night.
But it’s got to be borne. Some way or other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
I’ve got into a trap, and I doubt I’ll never get
out.”</p>

<p>“You <i>can</i> get out, Mattie,” Kirkby said
gently. “You’ve only to say the word.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but I can’t.” She looked down at her
hands as she rested them on the table, as if
already she saw ghostly fetters forming about
her wrists.... “Words won’t make any difference,
nor letters, neither. It’s my own self
makes the trap,—being too old, and being afraid
of things. You should have let us go when I was
younger and able to face it. You’ve kept us
here too long.”</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t me, Mattie,” Kirkby said, wincing
a little for the first time. “’Twas just life.”</p>

<p>“Nay, it was you, all right!” she said, lifting
her head again. She sent him a look which he
had seen more than once before, a hard, sneering
look which called him an enemy and hated him
as it said it. He met it quietly.... “It was
you kept us. And now I’ve got to go eating my
heart out till I die!”</p>

<p>Moving away from the table, she began to
walk up and down the room, clasping and unclasping
her hands.</p>

<p>“And it’ll be worse now than it was before,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
deal worse, a deal harder to bear. There’ll
be nothing to hope for, now.... It’ll be just
prison again, and the same old life right on to
the end. If I’d known things were going to
turn out like this, I’d have finished myself
long ago!”</p>

<p>She was crying now and wringing her hands,
stumbling blindly from point to point, and
blundering against things in her passage. From
time to time she looked wildly from side to side,
as if she saw the cottage-walls closing in upon
her. From his seat by the table Kirkby sat
and watched her, as only the night before he
had watched the firelight beat against the ceiling....</p>

<p>She came suddenly to a pause, and, putting
out a clenched fist, struck it against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“I can’t bear it!” she said in a loud tone.
“I can’t bear it, and I won’t! There’s my
children waiting for me Over There, and I’ll
get to them, if I have to walk. It’s my life that
I ought to have had, and that I’ve been cheated
out of, and I mean to have it.” Her voice rose
higher. “What is it goes wrong with things
when folks get cheated out of their lives?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>Her tone lowered itself then as suddenly as it
had risen, and became passionate and pleading.
“I take back everything I said just now,” she
told him gently. “I want to go....” Turning
unsteadily, she came to him, holding out her
hands. “You’ll not think any more about
what I said? You’ll let us go?”</p>

<p>“We’ll go, Mattie. Don’t you fret.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be just as it was, this morning?” she
pursued, unsatisfied. “The same as it was,
last night?”</p>

<p>“Just as it was, Mattie.”</p>

<p>A smile touched for a moment her tear-wet
face, and for the first time he felt the tears
spring to his own eyes. She looked at him
kindly.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be wild with me for chopping
and changing like this. I can’t help it. I’ve
got to see ’em all again, and the grandchildren
and the houses. I’ve <i>got</i> to see them. You
can’t plan and work for a thing all your life,
and not get it in the end. It’d kill you, if you
didn’t get it,—leastways, it would me....
But I shan’t chop and change again. I’ll get
the letter written first thing in the morning,
and the one for the passage as well. We must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
begin thinking about the sale, too, as soon as
may be. I did a lot of planning, this afternoon,
along with Mrs. Machell. I don’t know that
I’m best pleased to think of her living in this
house, though <i>she’s</i> pleased enough, to be sure!
I near told her to think on it was my home and
not hers, and would she kindly remember
it? There was the jam an’ all,—I’d nigh forgotten
the jam....” Her voice wavered as
she spoke, and she looked away from him.
“And the privet hedge,—I don’t know how I’ll
abide her having the privet hedge.... Len,
too, swaggering about the spot, and thinking
he’s as good a man as you.... I reckon
they’re thinking already we’re as good as
overseas——”</p>

<p>She stopped then, and into her eyes came
the fixed stare of one who regards a great and
imminent danger. The cry which came out
of her throat was no longer the cry of one
beating against walls, but the cry of one who
drowns....</p>

<p>“Nay, but we can’t! We can’t! I’m
cheating myself again. Just cheating myself,
that’s all.... I’ll never get to Canada, not
this side o’ the Judgment!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Flinging herself heavily into her seat, she
laid her head on her arms, and her great sobs
shook the silence. Outside in the darkness
a little wind got up, sighed along the paths and
was gone again into the darkness. An owl
called, flapping with clumsy wings across the
square of the window, and went out towards
the river. A sweet breath came in from the
gardens, where there were no flowers as yet
to scent them.</p>

<p>Kirkby sat where he was for a long time, with
his gaze fixed upon his wife’s bowed head and
labouring shoulders. It was the only way,
as he knew, to put a real end to the business, to
exorcise, by those cruel tears, the demon of her
forty years’ obsession. Canada went out of
her as she wept, and all the beautiful hope
which for so long it had represented. Through
every pore of her, as it were, ran out the poison
of her misery and discontent. She would be
broken, perhaps, when she came to herself, but
she would no longer be tormented. She would
be older, perhaps,—perhaps permanently grown
old,—but she might also have found the things
which belonged truly to her peace....</p>

<p>Yet even in the restraint of his measured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
wisdom he could not refrain from making some
attempt to comfort her. From time to time he
put out an apparently unnoticed hand, and
drew it back again. Presently, when he could
bear the situation no longer, he got up and
stood beside her.</p>

<p>He said: “Don’t cry, Mattie!... Mattie,
don’t cry,” smoothing her roughened hair
and patting her shoulder and cheek. She paid
no attention, as far as he could gather, until
presently the sobs quietened and the shaking
lessened. And instantly, as if at some signal
for which he had patiently waited, he began
to speak.</p>

<p>“I just want to say again, Mattie, that we’ll
go if you really want. Likely you’d rather
leave it over until the morning, but I doubt it
wouldn’t be wise. I couldn’t go through this
sort of thing very often, nor you, neither. We’d
be best to fix it to-night.... And you don’t
need telling that, if you could make up your
mind to it, I’d a deal rather not go. I’ve had as
bad a day thinking about it all as I ever remember.”
His detachment broke a little, and
pain crept into his voice. “I’ve loved the
place, and I doubt I can’t leave it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“I’ve hated it, and I can’t leave it!” Mattie
sobbed, lifting her head a moment and letting
it drop again.</p>

<p>“There’s some sorts of hate as is very near
love,” Kirkby said absently, without hearing
what he was saying. “Only just now you said
that to-day you’d seen it different.”</p>

<p>Mattie sobbed again, remembering the enraptured
hours in which that miracle had happened,
and realising that, now that she was
a prisoner once more, the enchantment would
have passed for ever.</p>

<p>“It was just because I was going to get away
from it,” she wept; “that’s all. To-morrow
it’ll all be nasty, just as before.”</p>

<p>“It’ll never be just as nasty, Mattie, whatever
you think,” Kirkby said firmly. “Once you’ve
looked at a thing with love, you never rightly
forget it. It comes creeping back into your
heart, no matter how often you turn it out.”</p>

<p>She said nothing to that, and presently he
went on again, speaking in a dreamy tone as if
he were weaving a spell of some sort about
her, and as if the sentences were being dropped
by something outside him into his tired brain.</p>

<p>“We’ve not done so badly together, Mattie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
you and me, when you come to think of it.
We’ve quarrelled a deal about this Canadian
business, I know that, but we’ve not done so
badly, all told. We’ve had a good life together
in a beautiful place, which is more than a lot
of folks get. We’ve been God-fearing folk,
on the whole, and we’ve as good children as
ever stepped. We’ve had a good life, Mattie,
and we’ve been together a long while. Children
matter a sight, I know, but we matter to each
other more. We’ve made something between
us in this spot as we’ll never have anywhere
else. We’ve made our lives.... When folks
get to the end of things, all that they’ve got
left to them is just their lives....”</p>

<p>She had ceased crying long before he stopped,
only sighing and bowing her head upon her
hand as she had done at the beginning. Her
mind, utterly wearied and over-strained, had
for compensation that curious quality peculiar
to extreme exhaustion of seeing clear in flashes.
By virtue of those flashes, so much more vivid
and poignant than those of the normal course
of thought, she was able for the first time to see
life as Kirkby saw it. For the first time she saw
the dignity and the beauty of the life to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
he clung, and to which such characters as his
own owed their inward essence. Canada had
gone out of her, as he had hoped, and into the
great space which it had left flowed Kirkby and
his gardens.</p>

<p>She remembered now that he had not been
in the dream, and felt again the sudden shoot
of fear with which she had first realised it. The
violence of that pang showed her what she had
never known until now, that Kirkby was more
to her than the children. He had not been more
to her once, as she had to admit. In her vigorous
youth and middle-age she had found him tiresome,
with his gentle ways and lack of push.
But the years had done their work.... They
had grown nearer together as time went on,
while the children had grown further. They
had been through things together of which
neither the children nor anyone else could
ever have any knowledge. Their very quarrels
had brought them together, as if in fighting each
other they had merely been fighting in order to
get to each other. Now, in this last struggle of
all, the last veil had been cleared away, and they
saw each other close....</p>

<p>Kirkby was right when he said that all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
you had at the end of your life was just your
life. This was their life, which they had made
together in this place, a completeness and a
dearness, now that they came to look back
upon it, formed, not only out of their happy
hours, but out of their grim ones. It was
theirs, and theirs only, shared by nobody else
in the world; a thing so much their own that
it seemed as if even God Himself must refrain
from looking at it.... It was this life, which
was all that they had, that Kirkby had feared
to lose if they went away....</p>

<p>She drew her hand across her eyes, and,
taking a deep breath, pulled herself into an
upright position.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s over,” she said bravely enough,
though her voice shook. “Over for good....
You needn’t fear I’ll ever bother you about
Canada again.”</p>

<p>“You’ll feel better to-morrow,” Kirkby said,
falling back, after his flight of eloquence, on
that eternal and feeble consolation; and she
laughed a little, though without rancour and
without bitterness.</p>

<p>“Better—or worse!... Ay, well. Never
mind about that. It’s over, as I said.... It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
seems queer to me now, though, always being
so sure that I should go.”</p>

<p>Her mind went back to the dream, with all
its richness and reality, and in one of those
strange flashes she saw both its meaning and its
hidden comfort. She had always known that
some day she would go to Canada, and she <i>had</i>
gone, although not in the body. Nor would
her body ever be able to go now, because she
herself would prevent it. But the dream had
shown her a way by which her spirit, at least,
could sometimes gain release. One of these
days, if life pressed too hardly upon her, she
might be permitted to go again.</p>

<p>She took up, after that, the encouraging
thought of Ellen’s coming, and the short but
beautiful happiness that her visit offered. For
already she was fast recovering her natural
poise. Her mind, clearing and gaining in
strength, fastened upon hope after hope, as a
child, strange to its feet, fastens and clutches
for support. Already she saw Ellen in the
house, and after Ellen the little girl; and she
rose up out of her desolation and grasped
bravely at the future.</p>

<p>Kirkby was asking for the Hall letter when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
she heard him again, that letter upon which
so short a time ago the whole of her salvation
had hung, and which now seemed as remote
and immaterial as if it had never existed. They
hunted for it together, and discovered it at
last in a spot where they could only have come
across it by the merest accident. She could not
remember putting it there, nor had she seen it
handled by Mrs. Machell. It was almost as
if some inner self of her own had secretly put
it away, knowing long before she knew it herself
that she would have no use for it.</p>

<p>Going to the hearth, where the fire, though
low, was still red and smouldering, Kirkby
made as if to tear the letter across.</p>

<p>“I’d best burn it, hadn’t I?” he paused
first to ask her, looking at her. “It’s better
not left about.”</p>

<p>For one last moment a pang shot through her
as she stood there, staring at it, seeing the chance
which she had foregone made concrete and passing
from her for ever. She put out her hand as
if meaning to snatch it from him, and then
dropped it again. “Nay, burn it,” she said,
turning away, and quivered at the tearing of the
paper. Even turned away she saw the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
flame which the letter made before it died down
and was no more....</p>

<p>“I’ll see about getting you a bite,” she said
then, moving away from the hearth, and remembering
with a housewife’s shame that
Kirkby must be nearly starving. Candle in
hand, she went to and fro between kitchen
and larder, and soon had the belated meal set
and waiting on the table. When it was ready
she called to him where he stood at the house-door,
staring into the darkness.</p>

<p>“I’ve just remembered I’ve promised my
pink vases to Mrs. Machell!” she laughed
ruefully, her voice, in spite of all that she had
been through, sounding natural and brisk.
“That’s if I went to Canada, I mean; and now
that Len won’t be getting the job I don’t like
to disappoint her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll buy you another pair if you want ’em,”
Kirkby answered, without turning. “Mason
and Mawson’s in Witham is as full of them as
it can stick.”</p>

<p>Mattie laughed again, with cheerful disgust.</p>

<p>“Nay, then, I’ve no use for ’em if there’s
that many going begging!... Your supper’s
ready for you now if you feel like having it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>He made no movement, however, to come
within, and after a moment she went across to
her jam-cupboard and threw it open. For
several minutes she stood gazing soberly at
its contents, while Kirkby, staring into the dark,
saw his dawnbell rising blue and exquisite
against the soil....</p>

<p>She fastened the cupboard again presently,
and turned about with a little shiver.</p>

<p>“Best shut the door, hadn’t you?” she called
to Kirkby. “It’s getting a bit chilly.”</p>

<p>He shut it.</p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
